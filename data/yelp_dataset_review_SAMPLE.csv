It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?

I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break!

I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. 

Second, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative.

It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.

It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. 

The guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. 

A big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....

He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.

Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.

And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.

So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. 

We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'

This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.

Oh...but good food counts too. 

We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!

My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...

The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. 

They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.

Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.

You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.

Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.",0,mVHrayjG3uZ_RLHkLj-AMg,0,5,2014-11-03,review,0

It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. 

The staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.

We ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!

My advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.",1,KayYbHCt-RkbGcPdGOThNg,1,4,2011-02-27,review,0

THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.  I recall that some of the sandwiches I got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.

We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. I tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. I've had better at almost any church that fries fish during Lent.

Iced tea was good, though I've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. Asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.

I may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that.

54,nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ,nkquD2FJgZvyj3bcobqlrg,"I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.

Why two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.

He told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.

Here's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.

So our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.

A month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. 

I completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.

Finally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! 

I was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said ""there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow."" Well, that didn't happen.

Then two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. 

Finally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.

My main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.

Pepsi

Buffalo Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n' cheese

Our drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area.  She would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed.  Eventually, our entrees arrived -- both piping hot.  I went straight for the macaroni and cheese.  It didn't taste bad, but I swear that it is made by Stouffers.  I didn't feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat.  I tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didn't taste bad with the brown gravy.  I moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strips.  At least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild.  I contented myself with eating them.

On the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.

Well, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.

The second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.

I was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.

We hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.

The mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. 

After the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. 

Well, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.

Thank goodness for the basic salad bar.

Even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.

The irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.

Third base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.

I ordered the meatball grill.  It was delish.  Served on thick cut Italian bread and made ""grilled cheese"" (mozzarella) style.  Meatballs and tomato sauce are both good!  Also, served with fries.  I brought home half the sandwich.

In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. 

Looking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! The cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!

""2 eggs and pancake $x.xx""

Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.

I easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  

When my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   

In case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, ""We need mugs"" just makes me love this place even more.

A few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!

We arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.
Inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.
The waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.
After reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. 
His bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.
The Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?
Everything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.
My only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.
It usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.
Coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.
While I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.",1,b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ,0,5,2013-04-13,review,1

Barb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.

The food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.

The service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.

The inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.

The prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.

So in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's.",0,zaXDakTd3RXyOa7sMrUE1g,0,2,2014-07-19,review,0

I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no ""pies"". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that ""they were out"". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague.

To recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?

It's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. 

My guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty.

So I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.

The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. 

We also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The ""steak"" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam.

I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued.  The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.

The last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  

As for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip.

141,9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA,d3w57QihQsYNDmZi3x1x8w,"I came here with two friends prior to visiting Apis Meadery next door this past weekend.  I ordered the General Tso's chicken, and my friends ordered the sesame chicken, crab rangoon, and another appetizer (egg rolls?).  They ordered the combo with less meat, and I ordered the one with more--the names were very similar, which I found confusing. The food took quite a while to come up (~15 min.), so I'd suggest calling ahead if you're in a rush.  While we were waiting, the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in Chinese, and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery (probably the same person).

To be honest, I'm not much of a fan of Americanized Chinese cuisine (I lived in Singapore for 3 mos. and have visited Hong King and Japan); it's been awhile since I've had it, and this dish reminded me why.  I don't care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce, nor do I care for the pre-cut meat in the dishes (I like to cut up my own meat, thank you very much), so the flavors and textures don't do much for me.  Having said that, my friends claimed this was the best Americanized Chinese fare they'd had in PGH (and they live in Squirrel Hill!), so if you're a fan of this cuisine, you can take that into consideration.

My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.

My pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.

Well, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. 

The first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. 

Can I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.

160,2cvC1yfkqbOKUgoQTxfzfg,eVZ6pr7f03hXSb-Q5cF2Vw,"What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.

First off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.

I am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  

The server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  

We also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  

By the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  

One of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  

They had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.

Overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.

From the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.

But it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.

My biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. 

But before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their ""mistake"" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).

It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.

People ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.

We ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.

Hard to tell if the deserts were ""homemade.""  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one.

Papa J's is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we don't have reservations and want a nice dinner out. My husband and I have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. I have been proved wrong.  We are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. Unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn't always open. I really don't understand why more people don't go here. 
My favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table. 

Also, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider Papa Js. They have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties.

Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots /pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a Darth Vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 !

One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said ""yep"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said ""What do you want me to do""?

My friend said ""An apology would be a good start"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said ""Get out and don't come back"" ???????? Are you kidding????

My friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred.

My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The ""dentist"" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with ""you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth"". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this ""bone graft"". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The ""dentist"" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.

During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,""Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!"" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough.

There are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on!

Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. 

One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! 

Spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. 

When I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - ""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll."" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!

Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience.

Today, for example, there were only two customers ahead of me, but one of them was having issues with a coupon.

My sisters and I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2-4 happy hour, which we read on the door upon entry; a lovely surprise. This meant that all shakes and drinks were 50% off! 

I ordered the western BBQ burger, which was 2 thin patties, cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, and fried onions. It came with shoe string fries (my favorite), all for the low price of $4.79. Are you kidding me? What's not to like! The food was actually pretty good! I liked it a lot. Since it was happy hour I also ""splurged"" on a chocolate covered strawberry shake. It was meh. Could have gone without it. The overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off, but the hot fudge saved it. But, how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?

Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.

So there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. So each was on for an hour and off for half. Of the 3, two were really good. Good singers, good piano players, and very funny. The third guy, well, not so much. Piano skills were fine. But his singing was not. When he sang in his range, he wasn't too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn't get to or forced things that just weren't going to happen. Often his jokes fell completely flat. Luckily the other two usually did most the talking.

They played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (Closer by NIN as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). We requested Britney Spears' Toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out REALLY good. That takes some serious talent to pull off. If they didn't know it (like Toxic) they'd find it and play it. They played a wide variety of stuff.

Part of the experience is based on the crowd. We had a couple larger groups (there on a Thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. Of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.

My friends were BIG fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from Rock Bottom next door. The waitress wasn't great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn't that easy to navigate. The bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.

If in the Waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes.

275,MJnIMhzm4onnjtzyprVXJA,emGY8AzjqZ3Tmp4tGyL2Kg,"While we were in Pittsburgh for the Winter Classic on New Years Day, we figured we'd see what the area had to offer for NYE. My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It's apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.

Sing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB's in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV's, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn't a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I'd say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.

This particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE's party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.

There were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto's Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV's ""Growing Pains."" I was sold from that point on.

I will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I'm not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn't bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.

Drinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn't brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn't scary and I'm not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there. 

The only down side to everything was group seating as you're sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead.

276,_vS9qNQvx8wVUOIkj4qfAg,39g2XybQLeCqDwas70SZdQ,"In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. But again, that's just me.

I WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. 

This is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. 

Keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! 

The guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. 

My favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). 

The birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go!",1,MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww,2,4,2011-03-21,review,2
278,bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ,Y8CsvVEZH3PyxTCuKXTvzA,"Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square, and they died out. Then when the chain restaurant magnet ""waterfront"" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.

When it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.

But today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century. The whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, Sing us a song you're the piano man has run it's course. I don't hate Sing Sing, but I could never come here more than once a year. It's a been there, done that kind of place.",4,MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww,5,3,2011-10-11,review,4

Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.

288,_f-Vd7RXlwd03jEzzLetOg,Gk8PYxCfvlp2VKnhGCAhpQ,"My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. 

It was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It's obvious they've been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, ""Rubber Ducky"" and ""Gangsta's Paradise"" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for ""anything else,"" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like ""yinz"" instead of ""you.""

I saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. I've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. ""I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,"" he said when she requested him.

There were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.

Luckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.

Sing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbräuhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list.",1,MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww,0,4,2014-02-02,review,1

Shut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. 

My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you.

Joe Dilorio's took care of everything from that point on. They dealt directly with my insurance company, ordered the parts (even getting new parts instead of the used ones my insurance company wrote the estimate for, at no cost to me), and gave me a call when all the parts came in.

However, this time was very different. I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, ""oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday"". He says I should expect this to probably be done before 3pm. 

I soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, ""oh, and we don't take checks"". 

The next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, ""yes, of course"".

This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day.

They have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. 

It is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos.

A FAMILY GATHERING!  

A WORK RETIREMENT PARTY!  

OR EVEN A DOUBLE-DATE!

A combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! Adult games!

The Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  

The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.

The one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.

Wonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. 

WHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  

POWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  

A GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. 

Time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  

DAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!

You pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).

Waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.

The games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.

The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.
The hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.
Finally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. 
I had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. 
After dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. 
All in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.",0,sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New,1,2,2012-04-23,review,0

We settled on Dave and Busters. I went on Facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $20 get $20 in play free (we split the card, it took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through)

The games weren't *quite* as fun as I remembered, but it was still a good time. The place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. When we did, the team at D&B could not have been more accommodating. To apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing. 

I think a lot of companies (I'm looking at you, American Airlines) could learn a lot from D&B. It cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games, but it made our experience so much better.

Dining: 2 stars

I had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time, and arrived early. They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. 

When my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.

The food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.

Bar: 1 Star

Drinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.

Arcade: 4 Stars

There are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.


Overall: 3 Stars

If you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.",2,sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New,2,3,2012-09-29,review,3

First let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.  Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.

The building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.

Speaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.

I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with ""Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you"". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless.

I'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)

The food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)

Drinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. 

The prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they ""cost"" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.

Overall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. 

I can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.",0,sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New,0,3,2014-03-27,review,1

The main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.

Your visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.

The staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. 

Note the ""drinks are weak"" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. 

Also note the ""prize center games suck"" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). 

The thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.

This review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.

Using survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.

What an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves.

Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  

Anyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  

I had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.",1,sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New,0,5,2014-07-08,review,1
365,fIKcxbs1u5oK74F-KgqGag,ZogsG2EF6VTKOYRim1SXEw,"Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!

It was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. 

I stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, ""Are you working?"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.

In between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. 

I was just really turned off from that experience. 

The good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me.

The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such ""games"", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience.

372,ILGPeuEGA36v3Ec-Co-eiA,7idP8cvvVS7yKab8iTdqyw,"Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead is always a good time.  They brew their own semi-micro brew here and generally have as many as eight brews to chose from.  Saturday night C and I stopped by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages.  

Our first issue of the night was getting to Rock Bottom.  As the restaurant is located in Homestead, a trip across the Hi Level Bridge was in order.  Little did we realize that the bridge was under construction and it took nearly 40 minutes to get across it.  Upon arriving at the restaurant we were presented with the task of finding a place to park which proved to be a daunting task.  This place was absolutely packed due to several locations sharing a parking lot.  After we got inside, our wait was about 45 minutes but luckily we were able to find a seat inside the packed bar while we waited.

The food at Rock Bottom is quite tasty, but it is all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers leading their menu.  They also have entrees such as steaks, but this place is not exactly known for their high class food products.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and we quickly determined that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar.

Our order consisted of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu including Chicken Nachos, Quesadillas and Ball Park Pretzels.  We had planned on splitting a meal for dinner, but by the time the appetizers arrived, we knew we had way too much food in front of us. 

The nachos were on a gigantic plate and piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and shredded chicken.  Containing just the right amount of jalapenos they had a nice little kick as well.  In much the same way, the quesadilla was much more than an appetizer portion.  With shredded meats and cheeses overflowing from the tortilla, there was enough food here for a two person entree.  The Ball Park Pretzels are the reason we come to this place.  They are always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt.

As far as the beers are concerned, I ordered up the sampler so that I could get a taste of the various brews.  They make a wide assortment of brews, from the Bud Lightesque ""Lumpy Dog"" to a dark ""Brew masters Choice.""  I found many of the beers to be quite tasty, however, nothing exactly special about them.  I would be that a taste test would find one hard pressed to chose the Rock Bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack.  Don't get me wrong - still excellent brews, but I would expect more from a place that claims to be a brewery.

I give it 3 out of 5 Rinsem's due to the lack of originality in the brews and the amount of traffic involved with getting in and out of the place.",0,McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw,0,3,2007-02-11,review,0

If I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.

GOOD:
- Decent beer...
- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.
- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.
- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.
- Amusing name.

BAD:
- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.
- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.
- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.

There are several dishes that are MONEY.
Appetizer:  Seared Ahi, Spinach Artichoke Dip
Entree :      Fire Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken.
Desert :      Carrot Cake (to die for)
Bar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  
Half the menu is really good, the other half is great.  
The beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area.

386,gJhd8oM1yRDDGe3SPaC5Gw,j7TfEsZYkO0ARRBnPyYLQA,"First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.

Now, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.

Service was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.

Beer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.

I REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.

Verdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.",0,McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw,0,4,2011-01-18,review,0

I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as (throw back) Hi-Tops but I did. I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space. 

Well I was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the Improv and Rock Bottom was close. 

Part of this is my fault...I always order ""healthy"" items at places that specialize is greasy bar food...then I am upset when the meal isn't 5 star.  

I started off with one of their wheat beers, it was alright. I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. 

My friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.

Pros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door

Cons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.

Often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise. Great if your out to see a band, but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you. 


Depending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables. It's alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. When the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. The view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the Improv. Which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you're stocking the local comics! 


The bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills. On any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen TVs surrounding the bar area. 

The menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese. Appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. Steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu. 

On Monday the burgers are half off...I don't think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special. However, if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials.

Rock Bottom is definitely a solid bar. As a microbrewery, their beer list is full of house brews. There are better beers in the world, but there are a lot of worse beers out there, too. 

What really makes Rock Bottom standout, though, is the food. My girlfriend and I shared an order of nachos, and it took everything we had to finish them. They also make a mean soft pretzel.

My friends and I love the atmosphere, the DJ (Todd), and the service that we get at Rock Bottom. 

Every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! 

As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! 

Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. 

The service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff.

It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. 

So, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. 

As for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality.

The hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one ""just to be sure.""  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.

Hub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was ""fine.""  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!

The tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  Not bad (even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn't have been worth the experience.

403,_Ud7sdn_khya8e2f3FNvWA,D5RqMgldgDatdrbRlP3l1Q,"I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say ""surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a ""chain"", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a ""bar-straunt"" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).

But besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!

I've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.

While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.

It was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.

As I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.

When we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, ""I have to go back for the rest.""  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  

During our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!

My only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.

Here's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? 

Additionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.
 
On a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.

My wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria. She just said it had too much ice in it. Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.

We started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. It took at least 15 minutes to get them. You get three sliders and they were very good.

My wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.

Our daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.

I ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average.

One side of the restaurant is the bar & bar atmosphere....with several TV's & 2 pool tables.  It's very wide open with extremely high ceilings.  The other side is more for families or people who aren't concerned about watching sports.  In general, it has a relaxed atmosphere.  I've always had quick & friendly service.

Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.)  The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.

I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken.

We walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.

Our server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!

We started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! 

Tom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.

Another note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... Yuck.

433,2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg,YXRTA4I09YOXx_zCfsPEwA,"So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  

So finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.

The service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.

The husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  

Furthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.

The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale. 

One thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.

My only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain.

Their beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). 

As far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. 

Almost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. 

Another item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. 

They also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. 

Their side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! 

I usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless.

Pros: Great comedians all year round! The food/drinks are very good and the wait staff is wonderful! The Improv is a great venue for upcoming and new comedians, I always see new, local talent opening for national comedians. In one show you will see 1-2 local comedians, and 1-2 national touring comedians. The Improv has a nice environment inside with general admission seating (first come, first serve). The EMAIL LIST is essential in order to receive free ticket packages and perks, as well as reminders of upcoming comedians!

Cons: Prices can be steep (it is expensive/difficult to be a regular). Food and Drinks are not cheap (no specials). Expect to pay $15- $40 for tickets depending on the headliner with a two item minimum. Waiting in line before the shows wouldn't be bad if you weren't forced to stand outside in any and all weather conditions. If it is raining and you'd like a good seat, you will pay the price. 

Overall: This 21+ venue is a great place to spend a night out with friends or loved ones. You may buy tickets in advance online/phone or buy your tickets at the box office at the location. I highly recommend joining the mailing list to receive free tickets! Check the calendar for upcoming shows and open mic nights during the week!

Some have been (surprisingly) very bad....Tracy Morgan. But it's always been a pleasant experience at the venue.  There's not a bad seat in the house and it's small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage.  Beware if you sit in the very front, you KNOW what's going to happen!

A couple downsides.... 

Waiting outside in a line in the dead of winter.  The lobby is so small you're forced to wait outside until the first show starts or the first show let's out.  And if you want a good seat, you may be waiting in line for a while.  BURR!

The two drink minimum. I kinda get why they do it, to make money, of course. But this means they jack up the prices of watered down drinks. Better to stick with beer and wine at these places. No frou frou drinks for me! 

Also, as to be expected, the food's not that great. In a perfect foodie world, places that served food would make it fantastic! Since that's not going to happen, you just go into those places hoping for the best. I've never had anything great here. Nacho platter too many re fried beans, to little nacho's....annnnnd I'm out!

The food leaves little to be desired. We decided for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show started at 7. Having a free appetizer coupon we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip along with the sauteed grilled chicken. Spinach and artichoke dip was good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkled on top of the chips. Sauteed grilled chicken - hmmm.... I think the chicken was frozen - definitely not fresh - and the guacamole was artificial with a glop of cheese. It looked like a mess with big ole pile of fries. A lot of food for $10.

465,1Spi4UfPNf-_gVO-jk7zYA,wumlcC301-oeUsmPGAwZ6Q,"My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. 

So tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? 

In addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. 

My friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc.

467,e7iHB7gZbVuD-UvJVKe3cQ,NeiNiLOX_HS2KvF320k3vw,"The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food, however.  Blah.

First off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    

Second, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. 

Third, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    

Overall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,0,2,2012-08-09,review,0
468,8syjbjJRkzxK9RUaKewUrg,SwrlnLby5YNCMo8IYBGzIg,"The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).

The setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.

It's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).

But the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.

Still, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.

A few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:
1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard.
2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said ""Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!""  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.
3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.
4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask ""would you like a refill on that?"" or anything of the sort.  They should ask ""would you like another one?"" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying ""we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.""  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,0,2,2012-09-05,review,3

Things you should be aware of: The staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks. I kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive. Their service is spotty

The wait staff is a little iffy. I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us. Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity. If our waitress was nice I would be more than glad to add to it but this time I was like no way!

The comedians are good, for the price, and many times you get a steal and can see a great comedian for a low price (i.e.Tommy Johnagin). However, be advised, if you attend more than one show every couple of months, you will see some of the same opening acts repeated. This is my biggest gripe with the Improv. I've been to the Improv about 3 times over the past 4 months and have seen the same opening acts a few times. I think they cycle through the same 4-5 comedians. Are there not more talented comedians in Pittsburgh? As noted in other reviews, another area of improvement is the drinks and food. I always attend the late showing so that I can eat elsewhere. The food is mediocre bar food at best. Nothing more needs to be said about that. I definitely don't mind the two drink minimum. I've been known to consume more than two drinks in one setting but, the drinks are insanely overpriced. $5 for a Miller Lite, $4 for a Snapple, $10 for a fountain drink with refills. You're better off having your two drinks during the show and going over the Sing Sing after for a draft .  . or four.

We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down puréed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. 

The comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our ""event"". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.

My car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.

The Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv.

Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand.  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here.  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office.  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.  It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats.  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron.  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.  The soda was $3.50! Yikes!

That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there.

So I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum.  Well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order.  This was nice.  I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.  Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks.  We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...

So the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.  

The one or two things I didn't like about the place.  The bathrooms are in the lobby.  As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid.  I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance.  The same also goes for smoking.  Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering.  Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this.  A stamped hand?  A ticket stub?  Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place.  

I would definitely return to the Improv.  I just hope I always have a rather positive experience!",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,0,4,2014-01-22,review,1

I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were handed a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn't offer us one either. She wanted our order, but as we were looking around the place, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she'll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! ""What about our food?"", we asked. ""Oh"", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That's all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was ""do you want me to take your food back?"". Really?!?! ""Do you want me to take your food back?"" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don't want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn't want them. REALLY?!?! Is this a joke? Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on? Sadly, no. The service didn't get any better. The food was lousy. Thankfully the standup was great. Lisa, Lisa and Matt all put on a hilarious show. Will I ever go back? Don't know. It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you're interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine's Day.",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,0,1,2014-02-15,review,0
480,ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ,dQGgmV1tl31l2eRVphz4-A,"My husband and I love going to comedy shows and have seen some pretty good acts at the Improv. Ticket prices aren't bad either. I am very particular about where I sit, and the person who seats you is willing to let you sit where you choose, especially if it's on a Thursday or Sunday night, since those aren't particularly busy nights.

I did have one bad experience, which is why I'm giving this review 3 stars instead of 4 (it only takes one poor experience, people!). My husband and I went to see one of our favorite comedians on a Thursday night. There is a two-item minimum, so we decided we would just eat dinner at the show. Well, we were mistaken. First of all, our waitress was rude and slow. After sitting there for 5 or 6 minutes without service she finally comes over and asks what we want. We both order a drink and food, to which she tells us that the kitchen caught on fire earlier that day so all they have are salads and desserts. I was annoyed that she even asked what we wanted instead of starting out with this important fact.

At any rate, I order a Caesar salad and a beer. It comes out and it's iceburg lettuce with shredded cheese, tomatoes, and other veggies. In other words, a regular salad. I inform the waitress of this and she seemed totally confused. I suppose she did not understand the difference, which was odd. 

Overall, I felt that there was no apology for the fact we couldn't eat, let alone everyone else in the place. Salad or dessert aren't the greatest choices when you are expecting to eat dinner at the show. I think the Improv should have waived the two-item minimum on this occasions, even if it cost them money. 

Afterwards, I emailed the Improv with my concerns. Never. Heard. Back.

That being said, I will most likely return to the Improv....but not for the service. Because it's a great place to see comedy shows and isn't that expensive. Customer service is terrible.",0,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,0,3,2014-03-01,review,2

I always have fun watching the comedians, but I can't help but leave with such a bitter taste in my mouth from how much of a rip off this place is.

First you buy the tickets, but if you buy online you have an outrageous service charge. The real kicker is having to buy a minimum of 2 items during the show, beers are $5 or $6 and the cheapest things on the menu, I believe. Cocktails are $11-$13. I think glasses of wine are around $8. There is a pretty good selection of food options. 

The improv does have a lot of great comedians who pass through! Even the opening acts are generally great! Line up early if you want a great seat right in the front!

After years of saying that I wanted to go, it really did meet my expectations! The ambiance is inviting, with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place. We were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating, though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first. The seating is layered in tiers. Each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating. It was very comfortable, roomy and an interactive set up. The stage is close to the seating (some tables are right at the stage) with little space between you and the comedian, which made it very interactive and fun. We arrived at the Improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm, with doors opening at 10:00 pm. We waited in line until the doors opened at about 10:15-10:20 pm, so they were really behind schedule. The show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedians before the main act. The show was over around 1:00 am. The only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that I have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu. ($30/ticket isn't enough?) I was not hungry and did not want to drink, so this was a bit frustrating, especially because it wasn't disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else. The server did not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and I got away getting 3 drinks for the night. The food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable, though if you want water you are looking at $5 for Fiji or sparkling. It was $8 for a glass of wine. $11 for bottomless soda, complete with a take home Improv glass. The other thing that I didn't like was that an employee takes your tickets while you're waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker. After one bathroom trip, the mark was gone, so I think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase. These negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and I would most certainly go back!

504,9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA,85g9TH1xo2-Sw5GJhvlB3g,"I've stopped by here a few times (most recently tonight) to pick up random groceries.  This store is located next to one of the bike trails that I frequent, hence its convenience despite being fairly far from my apt.

On the positive side, I appreciate the size of this store and the selection of products.  In terms of size, it's larger than the Shadyside Market District (my normal grocery store, hence my standard of comparison), and I'd say the product selection is very similar.  Unlike the MD, when I've visited, the aisles have seemed fairly empty of customers, which may be due to the times of my visits (usually between 7-8pm), as well as the size of the store.  Because it's not a Market District, the prices are a bit less expensive, which is nice.

On the negative side, the checkout always seems to take forever due to slow customers and/or employees, despite that I've only purchased a couple of items at a time.  The ""express"" lanes move at the speed of molasses, and the self-checkouts are even worse.  Speaking of which, this store has *way* too many self-checkout lanes (about a third of the lanes), and the non-express ones with the belts are unintuitive.

Prior to tonight, I would have awarded this store a rating of 4 or perhaps even 4.5.  However, checkout tonight was even more of a PITA than it usually is.  None of the normal express checkout lanes were staffed with cashiers, despite that I saw at least one employee loafing around talking to another.  So, I was forced to use one of the many self-checkout lanes.  Normally, I don't mind this, esp. when I'm only purchasing a couple of items, but the empty self-checkout lane that I spotted was one with a conveyor belt, and I couldn't figure out how to use it (not that it mattered, since I had only one item, but the self-checkout lanes must be operated using a very specific procedure--see below).  So, I moved over to one of the express self checkout lanes (similar to those in the Shadyside MD), which I knew how to operate.  However, I still managed to bungle the process since I forgot to scan my one item *before* I put it on the scale that doubles as a bagging station, so I had to wait for one of the ever-so-slow employees to come over and key in an authorization code so I could pay.

I'm not sure if the self-checkout stands that GE uses are standard in the industry, since I've never used them anywhere else, but I *hate* the whole weighing/bagging process.  In order to use the self-checkout stations, each item must be scanned and then placed on the scale, and if the weight isn't correct for any reason (including using your own bag), an employee is summoned to check it.  I assume the intention is to prevent people from shoplifting, but (1) it's a major PITA for both customers and employees; (2) most of the employees (including the one I dealt with tonight) don't care, and just key the code without even looking at the error message explaining why they were summoned; and (3) I doubt most shoplifters pay for any of the items they're pilfering--they most likely just stuff them into their purse, clothes, etc. and walk out!  /rant

I went here after a dinner date with some neighbors and couldn't believe how packed it was. We had to wait 10 minutes just to find enough chairs to seat 4 people. We ended up stealing them from other tables. Not to mention my hubby stood in line for 15 minutes just to get an Ice tea lemonade.

So amidst all the books, newspapers and magazines they have an audio and video section. The prices aren't anything to rave about. I can buy the same movies online for a lot cheaper there's just the waiting period. I do shop here sometimes for there discount books. I found a lot of great recipe and mystery books for really cheap, like under $5. That's a pretty good deal but considering there is a half priced book store who has a great selection of books for literally half the price of retailers, how can you beat those prices. 

B&N is more of a hangout spot with books in case you want to buy one right there and then. But everything is kind of confusing you always need to ask where something is.

Incidentally, ""The Hangover"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.

The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.

20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she ""definitely"" put our order in so it ""must have been given to someone else by mistake."" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?

The waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.

1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.

So why does Bar Louie get 3 stars? Happy Hour and a nice patio!

Happy Hour is on Monday-Friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 Drafts, $4 Wines, $5 Martinis, and 1/2 Price Select Appetizers and Flatbreads. My friend and I ordered 4 Martinis and 3 Appetizers between the 2 of us, and our bill was less than $40 total. Not bad!

I ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a S'Mores Martini, and both were tasty. We shared Bruschetta Pomodoro, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Roasted Vegetable Flatbread. The food was also good, and I would order all three items again in the future.

They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. 

I only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entrées, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass.

Service is hit or miss. Last time I went, I had just fine service. The time before that was also just fine. Sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doesn't know wtf he's talking about. (Once, I went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it was red zinfandel. I had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is, in fact, pink. I still don't think he believed me. It would've been amusing if it weren't for the fact that it was actually annoying).

It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. 

Tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.

We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with ""this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped"".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.

The food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never ""wowed"" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.

Still, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool.

The Sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in.  Occasionally there's live entertainment.

It's hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill.  Actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby Homestead Works.  But after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening.  The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.

1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. 

Next remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. (I'm not a mean kid hater) my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. 

If you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won't use them because they run around the park all day.

Unfortunately that element doesn't particularly care about ""censoring"" speech for 9 year old ears, and worse, in the Mon Tsunami, about personal space, since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and 'showing off' for the fairer sex, and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids.

Having said that, it's still a good day at the park. . . cheese fries, a cool dip in the pool on a hot day, some fun slides. . . 

I think in rating Sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park.  It is NOT policed particularly effectively.  if you take small children you have to be a diligent parent and be aware of your surroundings, paying attention to the group of 17 somethings thrashing around in your near vicinity, ""accidentally"" bumping into people for a reaction from their group.

I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.

So to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.

I seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. 

There was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)

The food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. 

Overall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park.

Let's do the compliment sandwich.  Positive - negative - positive!  

The negative... I feel like Sandcastle is the forgotten redheaded stepchild of Kennywood.  They keep pouring money into K-wood, but Sandcastle stays the same year after year.  Now, granted I haven't been there in YEARS, but everything seemed the same as I left it other than one new slide.  I haven't been there in about 9 years.  One new slide in 9 years?  Hmmmmm....

I see major places to improve.  Especially the pool.  I honestly think the slides are great, although you could always add more, they're still fun.  The pool... it's just packed.  So packed that you'd think they'd add a second pool.  Looking around it looks like they have the extra space.  Maybe an adults only pool?  Swimming with 20 zillion kids, plus adults drinking (yes I like that you can bring your bevvie in the pool... but it's kinda weird being around so many kids) and you start to wonder how clean the water is.  I mean, 20 zillion kids you gotta expect a good amount of kiddos are peeing in the pool!  

The sidewalks are also scalding hot.  I'd assume since many of the people are walking around barefoot you'd be able to custom order some kind of non sun absorbing surface.  And I""m NOT investing in those dorky water shoes, sorry!  

I'm ALWAYS happy to see a Potato Patch stand!  Just as good as K-wood!  They also serve chicken tender, which is nice if you want a little meat to add on.  Nothing more is needed for me!  Although the frozen drinks looked tasty and tempting, it was so hot out I was just downing water by the gallons.  You're also allowed to bring in your own snacks and food, which I think is nice for families who want to save a little mola.  

Again, Sandcastle is so awesome to have in the Burgh, it would be nice to see improvements.  It always seems packed in the summer months, so why not keep on improving it?  Or maybe they think don't fix what's not broken.  I just may stick to a cleaner, less pee filled community pool for my water fun fix!",1,uI0LvTXFACid1308KFO5ew,3,3,2012-07-16,review,3

571,qUPwH9Vvx65RxcGgZL-f7A,I0CGTPDXtQr9wmpVhAasKQ,"I LOVE Sandcastle. 
First, let me say that I'm reviewing the waterpark, not the people. The park has little to no control over the people that visit the park and the way they or their children behave. 

If you are going to visit, I would HIGHLY suggest you try to go on a weekday. I've attempted to visit on nice weekends before when the park has actually been at capacity and they are no longer allowing people in. It gets CROWDED on the weekends, especially if the weather is nice. There aren't a ton of nice days in the summer in Pittsburgh, so when there are nice days, people come out in droves! 

The slides are a blast, the lines are sometimes very long, but worth it. The lazy river is great when it's not wall to wall people. I really enjoy the new Dragon's Den but the line is CRAZY long for it! They also have a fantastic bar area, we have gone a few times and enjoyed a festive beverage while we enjoy the sun!

They have several areas for smaller children, which are all fantastic. 

If you are visiting, trying to take advantage of the giant eagle discount tickets, because these can get really pricey. You can also do a Sandcastle/Kennywood ticket, where you visit Sandcastle during the day and Kennywood at night. It's a fantastic deal, but boy could that be exhausting!",0,uI0LvTXFACid1308KFO5ew,0,5,2013-03-20,review,3
572,WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg,fYyklVeVe9Bcj71eA8UwWA,"okay, so it's not as fun as kennywood but i guess it's still cool... 

i planned ahead a day to go for me & bobby (his first time) it was supposed to be nice day, but the weather changed in 2 weeks.. 

we picked a nice time.. since it was literally supposed to rain all day, there werent any long lines/ we literally rode every water slide in one hour. then we went to head to the lazy river--- & it was closed! they said it was closed due to not enough attendence, but i mean come on. we still paid $70 for 2 people to come in this park where i just rode everything in one hour.. keep the lazy river open so i can kill an hour! aah. the cliff hanger was also closed- like always. 

so we just went and rode everything again. the Dragon's Den is sweet and the blue tubaluba is as well. bobby had a blast on the speed slides. i have to admit though, i do miss the regular body slide. 

another reason i chose august 3rd to go to sandcastle was that the park was open until 7pm rather than 5 or 6 like regular days. well actually at 4:45 we recieved a ""15 minute warning"" that the park was closing at 5 due to rain. ugh, a little more time would've been helpful. 

i couldnt hear the warning and asked an employee who said they were closing in ten minutes due to the weather and being under-staffed to stay open until 7. it started to rain at 5 and literally at 5:20 the rain was over . the park could've just shut down the rides until the rain cloud passed,  but due to being under-staffed would rather hand out rain checks.. which is fine because we get an another entire day, but i mean it would be a terrible inconvience from someone out of town who planned a family day. 

overall, the smile on my boyfriend's face was priceless, but i truly wish we could've enjoyed the lazy river and the park until 7. hopefully next time things go as planned....",1,uI0LvTXFACid1308KFO5ew,1,3,2013-08-05,review,1
573,_OvJhmhV_rUn5AxN613uOQ,JFowCnPgShIUVyMccY6vzA,"Sandcastle Water Park in P-Burgh was just ""okay"" for me. I really think that this place is geared towards children more so than adults or ""family"" because there isn't much fun here for people older than 16. The water slides here were lacking. There were very few of them and the majority of them are boring. The last time I was there (not too long ago) there weren't any extremely modern slides like a tornado slide, so they really have some updating to do. 

They do have an ""adult pool"" and bar area but it was so packed that it was hard to actually have fun in this area. The pool is very small, similar to one you'd find at a hotel chain. It has a hot tub area but it sits about 8 adults max. and people were fighting tooth and nail to get in. It wasn't too impressive to me. 

They also have a lazy river at this park and, while I do enjoy lazy rivers, this one was so packed that it was hard to breathe. People kept bumping into me and touching me and it made me grossed out. 

The one attraction that I did enjoy was the wave pool. It was crowded as well but large enough to fit everybody comfortably. The water was nice and clean (a big plus) and the wave action was strong. I could have stayed in there for the entire time we were at the park.

Overall, this place is just mediocre. It doesn't ""wow"" me very much but if you live in the area, have kids, and are looking for somewhere to go in the summer other than the mall, it'll provide them with a lot of fun.",0,uI0LvTXFACid1308KFO5ew,0,2,2014-01-28,review,0

Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away.

Both my wife and I and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so I decided to check this place out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store. Lee greeted us and showed us around the store. They offer mattresses, recliners, dinettes, daybeds, bunk beds and bedroom furniture. We found her a great mattress at a great price. While waking around the store my wife found a Serta iComfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on. 

Lee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through Wells Fargo Bank, free bed frame, free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer! I went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but I bought us a new one as well. No one can beat their prices! I compared the price of our new mattress to Levin, Macy's and Mattress Discounters. No one came close to the price we got at American Buyers. Everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free.
 
Take it from me, when it comes to your sleep, DO NOT BUY A CHEAP MATTRESS!!! We bought a cheap, supposed Serta mattress in 2008 from Mattress Discounters. The boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed. I don't think I will have that problem again as our new Serta has a full 25 year warranty. 

A couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered. The delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame, box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutes.

Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??!  Why??!!  How??!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. 

Just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night.

603,INVBi5surB5UbeDXWmqSuQ,vAuEnU_IM5kdoFFeri_8Iw,"I really don't know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore.  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  

My husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  

When the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: ""chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.""  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate ""drizzling"" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.

What we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  

The ""numero uno"" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  

The ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  

And lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling.",0,6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg,0,2,2011-12-27,review,0

605,T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ,8ndEF_w1kfWZnmdazV7E1g,"I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:

French onion
Chicken bites
Pizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano

Looking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good.

Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.

We were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.  

My fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a ""baked potato pizza"" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.

Overall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?

Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. 

Now onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.

I hadn't been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening. I was so glad they were paying cause  I was low on funds at the time.

We arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches. 

After ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.

I'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. 

We came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come.

617,DwXVdLxCHp9Uag-HjWgcnQ,2XFf4KdtyvaQ5gYEuGm4dA,"Pizza is a staple for me. I love everything about crunch crust, a nice rich tomato sauce, and a thick layer of melted cheese. I have never tried Chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles, Uno's was right there so we decided to try it out. 

Only a 30 minute wait for a Saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the Waterfront. We were seated at a booth in the bar area. The tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished. Only complaint, the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud. Good news, only happened twice!

The four of us decided to order two pizzas, the Pepperoni and the Farmers Market. I also ordered a Caesar salad because I needed more vegetables in my life.  

The salad. It was a big salad that I shared with my boyfriend. The croutons were huge and very crunchy. The Caesar dressing was not creamy, it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a ""bite"" to it as Chris kept on saying. I thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy, but who am I to say.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like I requested. 

The main dishes came out about 10 minutes later. I do not know what I was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as I was imagining. Two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me. But!!!! I was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection. 

The Farmers Market pizza had caramelized onions, spinach, SUN DRIED AMAZING TOMATOES, regular tomatoes, eggplant, pesto as a sauce, and a blend of cheeses. The crust was perfection being so crisp and light that I stole Chris' extra from his plate. The sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that I went looking for the slices with the most on them. It was a really really good pizza. We even ended up taking slices home with us! My eyes deceived me at first with the size! 

Then our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza. Cookie pizza? What sorcery is this? Matt, the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed. This cookie came out in a really large, bigger than our pizzas, dish. It had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream. WARM, right out of the oven, fresh cookie pizza. Oh sweet heavens, it was good. I am glad that I had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness.

I will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.

So I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. 

I went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. 

The girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.

So I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying ""Soooo, you DON'T want these???"" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! 

After that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). 

The thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug.

Here in Pittsburgh, it's the only Chinese place I've found that combines genuinely good service with quality food.  Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here.

The Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles.  Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too.

Their fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like.  Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do.

Portions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came.  The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees.

They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.

Aside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell ""General Tso's"" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  

The prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.

The only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It's also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I've been there for both.",2,JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g,2,5,2009-01-08,review,3

I went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  

My issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  

My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.

So we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:

Coca Cola
Iced Tea
Pan fried pork dumplings
Sesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup
Changs chicken with white rice

Our drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.

My egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.

Our lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  

I just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.",2,JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g,3,2,2009-11-30,review,2

I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.

Tonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.

I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).

After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.

What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?

The food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.

Got there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. 

The service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.

The portions are big and the food is ""alright"" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.

The food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.

Last time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.

Obviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese!

This was my first time here and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. 

We were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were ""meant to be shared."" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a ""here's your sauce"" kind of way. I remember thinking, ""That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce."" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. 

Forget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. For meals that were ""meant to be shared"" these sure are little portions. I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. 

Overall I thought the experience was lacking. P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way.

The food is typical PF Chang's: delicious. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of ""Chinese"" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entrées and have never been disappointed.

I've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.

The only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more.

Pei Wei is Chang's super convenient and cost friendly fast casual eatery that started infiltrating the Detroit market in 2007. Subsequently, that was the last time I stepped into a PF Changs until I recently moved back to Pittsburgh. Going from a Pei Wei to a PF Chang's is like watching paint dry or sitting in rush hour traffic or attending a WNBA game; it's so methodical and time consuming.

On our last visit to this location we were accidentally sat in a section in which the server had been cut from his/her shift. By the time we flagged down a server and everything was sorted out, we could have been halfway through our meals at Pei Wei.  Add in the wait time for a table, the sauces shtick, and presentation of the check and my head's about to explode. Chang's is more paced for retires and people on dates, not my lifestyle. I get it, it's a me problem.

680,ROX0FasafqFknZKaTwgf0Q,pd_8UmwCAvptIRFSw4aMsw,"Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.

So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.

I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two ""pork""-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.

Next came my ""lunch-portion"" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). 

At the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. 

On my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.

Glaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.

I've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The ""lunch-portion"" cost was $9.95.

At The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.

The mains are basically a half notch classier than a Chinese take out but I'm just not impressed. $15 for a small portion of orange chicken that is about as good as a cheap takeout seems silly. 

Where I think the restaurant really underwhelms is the soups and salads, I know it isn't the focus of the restaurant but the lunch sides that precede the lunch entrees are just bad.

This was the hottest new place on the restaurant scene and everyone wanted to try it. Fast forward to present day and you'd never believe that was ever the case. Chang's is poorly set up as one large open room that's rather noisy. Food came out quickly but was not as good as the Chinese take out we get from sesame inn. Spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a mass-produced feel to it. Took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later. Normally one of the great thing about getting Chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day!   Another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom. I don't expect a place to be immaculate in the middle of dinner service but this looked like the mcdonalds on Smithfield downtown.
The one bright spot was our waitress was very good and kept our water glasses filled. We just came from kennywood so we went through quite a few fill ups during our time there. Short of this, I'd probably give Changs two stars.

722,h55P31ql7npvguOLm0Yc8A,9U0FF69TOFifIe5YS5G8Pg,"Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.

1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.
2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.
3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said ""Oh... I don't know"" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say ""Let me check that for you"") he instead said ""Well, I'm going to hang up now.""  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.
4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.
5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.
6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.
7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate ""I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?"" to which she responded ""Yeah that should be fine"" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.
8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.
9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told ""Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year."" 
10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.

Over my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was ""Effing Men's Wearhouse.""  For example, at a restaurant, ""Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!""  ""Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.""

Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me ""I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding"" to which I replied ""Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA""

Congrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.

Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. 

One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! 

Spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. 

When I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - ""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll."" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!

Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience.

Back to mitchell's, I had the iceberg wedge with bacon, egg, tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. I also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo I ever tasted. It wasn't overly packed with rice, as a matter of fact, there wasn't much rice at all. It was mostly shredded crab, scallops, and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn't too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. It wasn't a lot of heat, just enough to make it exciting. As for the iceberg wedge salad, every once in awhile I need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). The star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. It was not overly thick, very tasty and savory. It complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. The cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. I tasted a little bite and must say it's the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. The cream cheese frosting was more buttery than ""cheesy"", it was a great surprise when you're expecting the normal cream cheese frosting.

768,yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q,yzaMXmAL8xO-FVu092GtRA,"Mitchell's Fish Market is a very nice place to eat...for a chain restaurant.  And actually, if it wasn't a chain, it wouldn't be too bad either.  The atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant - the room was warm and intimate, perfect for a date.  It wasn't too noisy or too crowded, and we were seated right away on a Friday around 7:30 pm.

Our server was friendly, and happy to give recommendations.  I started with a house salad, which I told the server I would split with my boyfriend.  She brought it to us on two separate plates, which I thought was a nice touch, and more than what I expected.  Poppy seed dressing was okay, it's pretty thick and creamy as I remember, but tasty.

I ordered from the special menu, since they had a bit of a lobster promotion going on.  My entree was a combo: lobster tail, and ""lobster pot pie.""  Now, lobster is a beautiful thing, but I have to say....it wasn't beautiful here.  It wasn't awful, but it didn't taste as fresh as I like (I'm guessing that's because the meat was frozen originally).  It's just a shame.  Dipping the lobster in butter was a pleasant experience, but it's supposed to be an ecstatic one.

The lobster pot pie was totes not what I imagined.  I pictured a flaky, golden crust, a delicious creamy lobstery gravy, and big hunks of lobster and vegetables.  Instead....I got what sort of resembled a small bread bowl made of a biscuit.  There was a lot of sauce, which was surprisingly orange in color and very rich, with some lobster chunks and vegetables that appeared to come from a bag of frozen veg (I'd recognize those tiny square-shaped carrot chunks anywhere)!  Whaaaaaaaat?  It wasn't bad or anything, but not what I imagined.  I was a little bummed out.  

So everything we ate was just fine, and nice when you're craving seafood....but I think in future I'd rather just head to the Strip, get a lobster, and cook the sucker up myself.  I didn't try their fresh preparations, so I can't say how those were.

I'd say in the Waterfront though, it's probably one of your better options.  Healthier and fresher than most of the other choices.  And the atmosphere is great, including the service.",0,usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ,0,3,2011-03-14,review,2

After biking on the river trail that led us to the Waterfront, we zoomed past what looked like a wonderful patio situation at Mitchell's, right on the river. We parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio. The waitress even filled our water bottles for us! The interior of the restaurant is very nice, sea-themed, and clean. The decor is really tasteful and classy. The outside was perfect. It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. Looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget the name). SO refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious as well. It was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good - definitely recommend! My bf couldn't help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don't eat, but he said it was very good. He also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal. This place definitely earns the stars and I had no idea it was even a chain. The waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality and service don't go down. I also checked out the rest of the menu and they use quality ingredients and the prices really aren't bad (it was the lunch menu - I'm sure the dinner menu is pricier.)

APPETIZERS: Cup of Maine Lobster Bisque for me -- soo good! My fiance had the New Orleans Seafood Gumbo which I had a taste of it and it was good, but I liked my soup better...very rich and creamy but full of flavor with a fair amount of lobster bits mixed in. The bread they served with the apps was fresh baked (I believe sourdough) and it was quite tasty along with the whipped butter. Our entrees came with house salads - had great elements, but I felt I couldn't enjoy mine because the dressing given was a poppyseed vinagrette and I can't handle too much acidity in my food these days. My fiance however cleaned his salad plate (not a sentence I utter often).
ENTREES: I had one of the specials, Grilled Shrimp and Scallops with roasted summer vegetables and tomato vinagrette (which I asked for on the side). The seafood part was great - the vegetables were so-so. My fiance had the special of Cod stuffed with Lobster (and some other seafood) with asparagus and a lemony sauce - I had a taste of his and it was really yummy, I'll def order that next time! We both finished our plates, which wasn't too challenging b/c the portions were moderate (I got 3  srhimp and 3 scallops for example) but still filling.

The bartender had her back to me and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me.

Another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink, she stated to him my order would be right up.   He then asked if she offered me a water, to which she replied, her order is going to be right up.    He placed a glass of water in front of me.

They do take reservations, but doubtful you need one on a weekday during lunch.  It wasn't busy when I was there on a Tuesday at noon.

Mitchell's has a cool layout - large full bar in the middle, private large rooms for large parties, smaller areas for business lunches, full dining room seating with tables and booths, and an excellent outdoor patio where you can watch people ride by on the bike trail.  

This is a seafood restaurant with lots of good options for fresh in season fish.  You can choose from a number of different fish to have prepared for salads, sandwiches, or just as they are.  I had the chopped salad and added scallops to it.  Delicious!  

The price range is reasonable and you can plan on spending around $15 with your lunch and a soda/iced tea.  For that price, you really can't complain.  I drop almost that much at Panera on a half sandwich and cup of soup with an iced tea.  

I'm sure it's much busier for dinner but I find Mitchell's to be an excellent place for a business lunch or just meeting friends.  I've been here for brunch as well and had an excellent Bloody Mary and eggs benedict with crab.",0,usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ,0,4,2014-07-22,review,0

Service. I was there with a large group for a meeting. They gave us a private room and two servers took care of us. They were efficient and very accommodating. Kudos. 

Appetizers: had the crab dip and calamari. Both were good. Servers brought extra chips with the dip as they were needed. I'm always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point. Dip was good. Calamari was done well. Preferred the shrimp cocktail Sauce with it versus the Asian type soy sauce that is served with it. 

Wedge salad with bleu cheese. Waaaaaay too much cheese and I like bleu cheese. 

I had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry! Green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days. Simple green beans would have been more appetizing. 
Tuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it. Was not over cooked. Potatoes as expected. 
Other dishes seen--fisherman's platter. Looked a little greasy, but that's expected from me in a full fried dish. Would be nice if this was offered broiled as well. Crab cakes and filet looked okay.

The whole point of going to McDonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life.

Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.

Got greeted by the staff, and my girlfriend and I got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes.  She explained what she was looking for, and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at.  I wound up talking to another person working there, and let them try to find a bike that fit.  (I'm 6'8"", and as I found out, fit pretty well on an XXL Scott 65cm frame.)

Anyways, back to my girlfriend's experience.  What impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner, they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there.  And then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn't ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  There was no hurry.  There was no pressure.

The amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it's worth it to browse here.

And, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  

That said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  

Customer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.

841,SVd6Re9tpabo413b4LghYw,CkW5rUoYS8amqnwFygBMBw,"This is the best experience I've had at a bike store in the Pittsburgh area.  I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.

At Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.

Also, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you ""You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!"" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me.",0,4ykgzzzGEWjMD5lwk1-l9A,0,5,2009-04-27,review,0

This review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. 

At BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:

I bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says ""Should be ready in a few days"". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would ""duke it over"" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?",0,4ykgzzzGEWjMD5lwk1-l9A,0,2,2009-06-09,review,1

So, first of all, one of the shifters on my bike turned out to be defective (not super-unusual for the Shimano short-reach shifters, also totally not the shop's fault -- these things happen).  Since it was covered under warranty, BBB switched it out for a new set of shifters, at no cost to me.  I had my bike back in a couple days, no muss no fuss.

My husband got a used road bike from Craigslist, and we brought it in for a tuneup.  The bike had several things wrong with it, due to a shoddy assembly job, and BBB basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it, cleaning it and replacing various worn-out bits.  I can't remember the total cost of this, but it was under $100.

I would totally recommend BBB, due to their general awesomeness.  I haven't had any of the tuneup-related woes that other people have had with this shop, even when bringing in a bike that I haven't bought there.",1,4ykgzzzGEWjMD5lwk1-l9A,0,5,2009-10-04,review,1

This is by far the premier shop in all of western PA, and arguably the state. 

Glenn the shop owner is one of the most knowledgeable men in the U.S. when it comes to cycling.  Having spent time in Europe, and with some of the biggest names in the industry, he truly knows what he's talking about.

Furthermore; he's a pleasure to talk to, incredibly friendly and passionate as anything about the sport.  As for bike fitting, this is the only shop I would go to, Glenn's knowledge and background can't be competed with, and he is incredibly thorough.

Yes, they equipment is expensive, but that's a result of the quality they carry..not them setting prices high. Cycling is expensive, end of story.

I would encourage getting fitted and even buying a bike there, but going back for service is a whole different story.  Same day service is unheard of here, even for the simplest of adjustments, no service is available at all on the weekends.  the first time I took a bike there to have a rear derailer hanger replaced and re-adjusted (I had already purchased and had the hanger) 11 days went by before I returned to pick my bike up after not being called.  I figured it was just a fluke experience and gave them the benefit of the doubt.  The second time. I took a bike in to have a damaged shift lever replaced with a new 7800 pair. I called after 9 days and they said it wold be 2 days more.  when I showed up 2 days later it still wasn't done, it took 2 more following that, 13 days total.

The crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom, while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice. The dough itself is flavorful, not too... well, doughy. The sauce is great, and they don't drown the pizza in it. There's just enough cheese; not so much it's an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you can't tell it's there. If you can go while Mama's working, all the better.

You can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls. Two of us split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out for $10. You can't beat that. And I'd put Bellisario's pizza up against any in the city.

I grew up a five minute walk away. My mom loved Bellisario's and I have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home, my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly able-bodied children around to go pick it up. Every time I have a slice, it brings back great memories. But I've had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as I think it is.

It's a little divey, stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza, but it's perfect. If you're in West Mifflin (say, going to Kennywood), drive over and eat a pizza.

This store is a little out of the way if you're not from this area, and you may feel you're getting a little lost since you end up driving in a more rural looking area until you get to the plaza where it's located. It has lots of parking in a private lot and trust me the outside is no indication of how big it is inside. 

This store has so much stuff packed into a fairly large space. The clothing selection and shoe selection is the real gem here. I love knick knacks as much as the next person, but eventually I'm going to need to pick up a new dress or jeans to cut into shorts.

The place wasn't packed, which is a nice surprise for weekend day at a big thrift store. The clothes were organized well and the prices were low. There was one thing though that sort of bugged me... It's not that I LIKE the smell of thrifted clothes, but I feel like anyone who thrifts knows what smell I'm talking about. This place does not use whatever it is that makes the clothes smell like that. I imagine it's some sort of disinfectant spray. You would think it would be a good thing, but what it meant is that the cute summery dress I found smelled like cat pee and cigarette smoke. No thanks.

My only complaints about American Thrift would be an outrageous $20 minimum for cards. 

Two women working one register together that we're the least friendly store employees I've encountered since 16 yr olds who hate their lives.

No dressing rooms. I don't know what this theme is with thrift stores not having them, but I'm getting really good at changing pants in the middle of an isle without flashing my bits to everyone.

I live in St. Louis, and it seems like the only pierogi I can find are in my grocer's freezer. Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.

The place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. Inside, though, magical elves... uh... I mean fabulous Polish women... create deliciousness with love -- and butter. Have I mentioned that butter is a part of the deal? Because it totally is. You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.

Oh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I'm in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you'll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.

You also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.

Besides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next.

Awesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.

The only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness.

876,Q9n_RbF8px9R0GL6xfyWbQ,sxjksyeVSrlwPozy0bZTwA,"I was planning to attend a conference in Pittsburgh and was researching food joints that I wanted to check out. A friend of mine insisted that I go to Pierogies Plus telling me that the food was so good that ever since he went that he has had pierogies mail-ordered to his house each year. While I have never been a huge fan of pierogies, I figured that I should heed my friends advice since he generally steers me to places I enjoy. Let's just say in this case, he hit the ball out of the park.

I actually wound up going to Pierogies Plus straight from the airport. After getting in a rental car and plugging in my GPS, imagine my surprise when my GPS announced ""You have reached your destination."" and I found myself sitting outside what appeared to be an old service station. When I walked inside and up to the counter, I found a crew of Polish women rocking out every kind of Pierogi imaginable. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of choices.

Wanting to try everything, I wound up going with their Sampler Platter #1 which was a small haluski (a noodle and cabbage mixture), a stuffed cabbage, and four pierogi ( I wound up going with a potato with bacon, potato with cheese, potato with jalapeno, and potato with meat). The food was outrageously good. I'm actually salivating just thinking back on the meal. The stuffed cabbage was not marred by the typical dryness that can afflict that dish and was perfectly sauced. The haluski, a dish I had never heard of, was amazing.

While I can't expect everyone to make their way to Pittsburgh solely to go to Pierogies Plus, do yourself a favor and order some. Those wonderful ladies deserve your business. Your belly will appreciate it!",0,LiMXTPwanF3LkkKHklFCjw,0,4,2011-03-22,review,2

The journey there took us past bizarre, abandoned-looking buildings, and roads that suddenly ended in cement blockades. The area is prime for use as the setting of a slasher flick. 

BUT, the weird drive is totally worth it. Pierogies Plus is so legit. 

The setting is reminiscent of Seinfeld's 'Soup Nazi': tiny interior, people standing in line shoulder-to-shoulder, and a lady behind the counter brusquely taking orders. Oh, and make sure you order your 'rogies ""hot"" if you're planning on eating them soon! Otherwise, you get 'em frozen. (There's a slight up-charge for the hot ones, btw -- electricity ain't free!) 

They were out of the plain potato and the potato and cheese varieties when we were there, so I had the platter with pierogies and kielbasa. I opted for the sauerkraut pierogies, and they were SO good! The interior was filled with sauerkraut mixed with potatoes, as opposed to many other sauerkraut pierogies I've had that were filled with only kraut. I definitely prefer the potato/kraut mix! They were also drowning in butter and onions. Like, serious, serious butter - Paula Deen has nothin' on these ladies' butter usage. The kielbasa was awesome, too! I also sampled their haluski and it was the best I've ever had. Tons o' butter, seasoned with generous amounts of salt 'n' pepper, and there was quite a bit of sautéed onions in the mix, which added even more flavor. 

A few things to note: They have coupons you can print out on their website, but you must cut them out if you're gonna bring 'em in and use them! You cannot just hand them the whole piece of paper. If you want to order a special variety, they need 2 days advance notice (check their site to see what the 'special' ones are). They do accept credit cards, with a $10 min. Yes, some of the ladies are not the friendliest, but the food is so good, they can be like that, and you'll still come back for more!  And, parking is quite limited there. Pretty sure the building is a converted service station. :)

I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  

Inside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  

One random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.

Their steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.

The seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain ""I taste like iodine"" flavor.

The advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive).",0,T49ZvBa6mD4xHSmjHe-ArA,1,2,2010-04-12,review,1

922,kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA,A_C28_4et1R9NVG9ojl81Q,"I stopped by here two nights ago as part of a night where I would try three different pizzas in the Bellevue/Avalon area.  I called my order in for an XL pizza ahead of time and was told that I would have a 15 minute wait until it was ready.  Since I only had a general idea of where it was located I ended up parking near it trying to locate it and then driving past it before finally locating it in a small strip mall right next to Lincoln Ave.  There isn't too much to say about the inside of this pizza place except that they have a counter up front with a little bit of room to wait and no customer seating, not that this is a bad thing.

Pizzas in general can be broken down into three separate components: cheese, crust and sauce.  This pizza actually had the least amount of cheese on it of all of the pizzas that we tried but ended up being my favorite which would be surprsing if you know me.  The cheese was not that strong in flavor but the amount of it let it pair perfectly with the sauce which had a nice spice profile (strong on the garlic and maybe some oregano?) coming through it.  The crust on this pizza was the thinnest of the bunch that we tried and was cooked nicely which also had a little crisp which I loved.  

The bottom line for me is that I would head back to R & B's again in the future for pizza.  It was easily the most expensive of the bunch that I bought last night at $12.79 after tax for an XL but as the old adage goes ""You get what you pay for"" and if you like garlic then you should like this pizza.",0,T49ZvBa6mD4xHSmjHe-ArA,0,4,2014-01-16,review,0

My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me ""Stay out of trouble"".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.

The bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.

934,tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ,J_YCuxcejf_HivFLK6tJbA,"Recently I've found myself patronizing Bellevue a little more, namely because I've bought a house in the area, and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of Mayberry RFD that is the quaint main street. Luigi's is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic Italian in a comfortable setting. It's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.

I've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent...it's good...satisfying. Not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'. It's just a good ol' night out for some pasta or lasagna, with a side salad, garlic bread and conversation with your pals.

The portions are ample, the prices are reasonable, the flavors won't knock your socks off and make you think you've died and gone to Sicily, but they won't make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering Chef Boyardee either. The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. 

The crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.

I've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. But I've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. They taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.

And for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what I'd hope for. A place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal, on a semi-regular basis, in a comfortable setting, with no frills or pretense.

The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.

The food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.

Nancy was my nail technician, and she greeted me warmly and helped me over into the pedicure area. Pro tip: Don't wear a past-knee-length skirt, as it can make straddling the foot bath to get into the chair slightly awkward. Nancy helped me out like a pro and I was all set.

The pedicure chairs have a massage feature that reminded me of the Migun massage tables. They don't just vibrate; they knead. The controller is right next to you, so you can stop and start as you like. I just made sure the thing kept running the whole time. The foot bath was nice and warm. I'd brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxing.

Nancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isn't much of a problem. She completely understood that I was super-ticklish from the flinching involved, and somehow managed to be very careful about it. It wasn't at all unpleasant, which is what I'd kind of expected.

This is the awful TMI section, so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive. Since I've never had a pedicure and I tend to walk around either barefoot or in thin-soled shoes, I had quite a lot of callus built up. The removal was kind of disgusting, so I just didn't look, but it didn't hurt at all. I also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes, and she dealt with them gently and quickly. I was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon, but it's a week later and my toes haven't turned gangrene, so all's well that ends well.
END TMI

Even though it wasn't the spa pedicure (not sure what else THAT involves), I got a full foot and calf massage. Polish on and all done! At which point I thought I might as well get a manicure, too.

The manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage, and was very nice. Total cost was $37 plus tip (I gave her $10 for having to deal with my nasty feet). I had some fun conversations with other patrons, and overall a great experience. I'd go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so, but this is getting placed on the once-a-month schedule for sure.

The polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week. The manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days, so I'll probably just stick with doing the polish at home, although I can't complain about the massage and cuticle care.

Again, I don't have other salons or spas to compare with, but it seemed like a good, basic service with a few little extras. The staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in. They do take credit cards, and you can put the tip on the card as well; I brought cash for that as I am not used to salons taking tips on cards.

They also offer acrylics (which I don't do), gel nails (which I'd like to try), and nail art. I'm not sure if they do waxing. I am sure that it's a friendly place, that it's clean (important!), and that they made me feel relaxed even though I was beyond nervous going in.",1,jTAKV9zLlAjouAKh4Wd7Yg,0,3,2011-08-23,review,1

We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied.

Their cakes hit the top of my list (with Edy's downtown coming in second).  The batter is light and moist while the icing is smooth -- not too sweet - not too 'lardy'.  By all means, feel free to give them a decorating challenge as their peeps got mad skillz.

In my experience, Pittsburgh natives don't seem to realize how good their sweet tooths have it here, till they move away.  So, when I travel westward for the holidays I bring some Lincoln Bakery sweets along.

I highly recommend their Burnt Almond Torte with either custard or lemon filling for nearly any occasion.  I get these for corporate gatherings often and they always go over well - and you know what they say about trying to please everyone!

I'd suggest giving them a few days to a weeks notice as they keep pretty busy.

The cakes are incredibly moist and the butter cream icing is just the right amount of sweet. My favorite cake is a yellow cake with FUDGE icing (not chocolate but FUDGE)!! I've also had the raspberry filling and would recommend that as well. They are incredibly creative with their decorating of the cakes including wedding cakes but if you want something specialized (nonstandard icing, etc) be sure to call ahead and place your order in advance. Warning: Saturday mornings you will surely encounter a very, very long line whether picking up your order or just swinging by for some goodies. 

Even better than their cakes are their petit-fours (chocolate with chocolate icing or white with vanilla icing). I've ordered them for bridal showers or just stopped by to pick one up for myself. They are the perfect size for one person (if you aren't on a diet). They do sell out of these so place an order ahead of time if you want a large order or stop by early in the morning to make sure you can get them.

 This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! 
I couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). 

I would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  
But if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money.",1,kKmvSJ6Z8UVPdrnL74bqrg,2,2,2009-04-15,review,3

2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they've laundered everything thoroughly. 

3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It's mainly items along these lines.  You're more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you're over the age of 21 is a good thing.

4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it's addictive.  You never know what you'll find.

A summary of a few things I've bought here: a 6 dollar designer knit dress, a few silk twinsets ($2-$5), countless heels, two pairs of Birkenstocks and two pairs of Doc Martens ($4-$8), a dressmaker's bust ($5), a pressure cooker ($7)....

You get the picture.  The prices aren't rock bottom, but close enough, and the quality of the clothing will help anyone but the stingiest person get over the 50 cents extra.

The store is full of wonderful pieces of clothing, all arranged by color and type (not by size, which is unfortunate). I found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to high-end business attire to super-trendy teen clothing... what surprised me most about this store was the QUALITY of the clothing. Almost all of the pieces were flawless, a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that. Brand names were bountiful; Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Chico's, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, American Eagle, H&M. There were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the 80s, bright colors and crazy shoulder pads that would have made a more adventurous fashionista very happy indeed!

The clothing smells wonderful, not musty or dirty as in some thrift stores, and there was even a large selection of plus-sized clothing carefully culled out in a special section.

I went to Red White & Blue to find some business attire for my new job, and came home with two gorgeous, flawless statement blazers from Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic... for a total of $7!

I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders, DIning sets, paints, sculptures and sooo much more. I found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for $4. The lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather. It's such a great find. There are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape. 

So the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find. The Store has certain days that offer you %50 certain color tags. I went on a Monday and it was half off yellow and white tags. Other days its half off blue, or green or red. I love to go on Saturdays!! This past week it was half off every tag except white. I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited.

The clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. 

Shopping here is a gold find!! My sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift.

Huge selection of clothing, housewares, electronics and furniture, but NO FITTING ROOMS!

Yes, you read that correctly. No fitting rooms. Are you kidding me?!?! It doesn't completely overshadow the fact that they have great items, but when 95% of what you offer is clothing, you've got to have a few rooms for people to try stuff on!

The clothing is organized by style and color, not by size, so be ready to dig. Same thing with the shoes.

I asked a staff member where to try on clothing and she directed me to the back corner of the store where there were two long mirrors hanging side by side on the wall, directly in front of the kitchen section. I was slightly confused for a minute and then realized that was my only option. I decided against even peeking at any pants or blouses and instead went for jackets and sweaters I could easily try on over my shirt. 

Now, the mirrors are directly side-by-side, so if there are two people trying things on over their clothes (so weird), you're going to be right up on top of them. Not to mention you'll be right on top of people browsing through the kitchen section.

A lady I was chatting with told me that she has seen women come in wearing tight fitting shirts/tank tops and spandex tights (hey, those are somehow socially acceptable as pants in public now, anyway!) so they are able to easily try everything on over their clothing (still weird).

As annoyed as I was about the fitting room situation, I will probably make a trip out there again in the future to browse based solely on the size of the store. I just might have to wear some spandex.",1,kKmvSJ6Z8UVPdrnL74bqrg,3,4,2013-11-22,review,3

With that being said, there are a number of drawbacks to shopping here because of its popularity. It starts with the parking. There are a few spots in front of the store, with two ""overflow"" lots that quickly fill up. Getting out is a bear if you're heading back towards the city, like I usually am, because to pull up to the traffic light you have to go the wrong way through the very narrow parking area in front of the store. Crossing three lanes on 51 without the help of a traffic light just seems like a bad plan.

Once inside the store, beware of other customers on the weekends. I've encountered aggressive shoppers on multiple occasions who are usually welding carts as weapons. Let's just say some shoppers think it's OK to block off entire aisles so they can peruse a section.

Other notes: There are no fitting rooms. I sometimes try on clothes over the ones I'm wearing in front of a mirror, because hey, it's a thrift store.

Also, they're cash only.

Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.

Bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices, and The Rusty Nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood haunts.

It's touted as a 'diner' in many of the reviews, but it really is a step above your average 'diner', and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger, or entree. I've not made it there for the breakfast, but have always been satisfied by the dinners.

Rusty Nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale. In fact, I would imagine the Sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts, from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks. As long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyor-belt diner, all is fine. And indeed, all IS fine.

So few of our local 'diners' are up to snuff when it comes to serving up decent 'diner' fare, that I can't call Rusty Nail a diner. It's a neighborhood family restaurant. Period.

Burgers, meatloaf, pot roast, fish sammiches, salads, pastas...a varied but adequate menu. Fair and decent prices. Friendly and attentive service. A cozy enough atmosphere (although I have to say AGAIN in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple TVs in the space, for gods sake, can ONE of them NOT be showing SPORTS coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons. 

During my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. A nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. At one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped OUTSIDE to have his conversation. As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!

Bottom line...Rusty Nail is comfortable. It's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. It is what it is. A great little neighborhood spot FOR the neighborhood.

This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!,0,ucKQlQvOeJxETLNkpKcaSw,0,5,2014-04-06,review,0

Dude working at Pistella's: Need help?
Me: Yes. I do not drink this stuff, but everyone coming to my house tonight does. Help!
Dude: Any idea what your friends like?
Me: Umm... my husband likes to drink Dos Equis. My one friend likes 'lighter' beers. Oh, and I am broke because I just bought a lot of chips and salsa at Whole Foods.
Dude: Girl just follow me. Here, we are having a sale on the Dos Equis variety pack. That has something for all of your friends. It even has a Christmas beer to make everyone get in the holiday spirit! You will be the hero of the party! And I will carry this to the register for you and everything.
Me: Thank you!
My friends, later that night: Girl you rock. We are all happy with this beer, and that leaves more vodka for you!

I think they did it because they are hopelessly irresponsible. Although they charged $70 for this brutally simple operation they have not even trimmed dog's ears and tail. Consequently, the dog has disproportionally long hair on its tail and the ears.

It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a ""nice"" restaurant?  Classless.

We had reservations for 5 people at 7PM this past Saturday. Two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. She was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar.

When asked what ""awhile"" was, she said 20min.  But then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which I take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).

Food was a let down. Potato latkes were greasy and blah.  Fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  Pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  Others had the same sentiments.

It was a relatively nice evening, and I thought the concept of fresh-air dining was too good to pass us by. We were immediately greeted by Jen, one of the co-owners, as we entered. I made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop, and she volunteered some additional information about their production that I found to be very interesting. 

I really loved the bistro burger. I requested it to be prepared ""Medium"", and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times I've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. Nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. We also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. I thought the ziti was a bit dry, but the sauce and cheese were delicious. We really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. I was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. My partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which I found to have that ""homemade"" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants. Our friend loved her arugula salad, and as a seafood aficionado I was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had. Our service was prompt---our water glasses had barely gone half-empty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them.

AFTER Pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It's no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.

On our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.

The food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business.

I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  

My two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  

I ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  

The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  

Added bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).",2,ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg,0,4,2012-01-24,review,4

It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.

The restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.

The table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well.

We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. 

Baked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. 
Lazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. 
Panna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.

My friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? 
We tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.

I don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there.",0,ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg,0,1,2014-08-14,review,2

I don't have one favorite dish because I usually order one of the specials, which change often. I ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The Bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta (I think the menu has it on rigatoni) was as good as what I had in Italy. My son had the seafood risotto. It was so good, I need to order it next time.

My brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home. He loved his meal and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 of us). He was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time.

After my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to ""apologize"". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would ""never salt his steak again"". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. 

The drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. 

Overall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have.",0,ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg,0,1,2014-10-07,review,3

Very awkward.t.  Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.

  Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? 

To make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.

I don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said ""dish looks beautiful."" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  

The table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says ""I really enjoyed the steak you sent back."" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!
At this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said ""it's not my job to make people happy"" that's strange considering he wants our business. 
So the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.

Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:

1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.

2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   

3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).

4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).

5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.

Most of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.

Also, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.

However, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.  There is a reason that store was nicknamed ""the dirty bird.""

The set up is ridiculous.  I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it.  Aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had.  It's like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it's too late to turn around because it's the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you've been walking forever.

I can go to Trader Joe's and find much better produce for less.

A pet peeve of mine is the self-checkout lines. Two of them are express lanes for items less than 12; the other lane has a belt if more than 12 items are being purchased. There should be TWO LINES but for some reason customers want to form one long super line, which holds up everything. The staff rarely sorts this out.

Unfortunately Kelly, Melissa, and Jen were not there so I settled for whoever was free at the time. 

Worst trim of my life:
she cut off over an inch more than just the dead/split ends
she did not cut the hair how I described initially
she did not change the cut to how I repeated during the cut when I noticed she was cutting it straight across instead of curving it in the back, which does NOT mix well with my curly hair
after retelling her how I wanted it cut, she compared this tragedy to deaths of family/friends and how I should get over it
the beautiful long layers I had and wanted again are now choppy, medium layers
my left side is even choppier than the right side of my hair
I fear straightening my hair to make this unevenness less evident

Also, the Supercuts Oakland location is horrible at waxing eyebrows unless you are lucky to get the only woman of color there.

It never did look right, so I just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people. I didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it, as I highly doubted that I'd get any money refunded and I certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it. 

I then figured, hey, this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing, right? Right! But their service is so bad that I gave up on that too -- I got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble, but the last time I went in, I had called ahead to put my name in and was told that I would be next on the list, and to show up in about 20 min. My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. 

The ""stylist"" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in? Nope! She called him over and I said ""sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line"" and the lady said ""oh we don't do that."" WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. 

And waited, and waited, while one ""stylist"" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been ""on break,"" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said ""after I'm done here,"" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving.

Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.

Tasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because ""your parents teach you good to talk Chineees"". 

I'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.

The new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.

Tasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.

Tasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good, especially considering the price. Before I continue, I will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(As was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(I assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).  However, I will chalk some of it up to my mistake because I thought they closed a half hour later,  than they did, and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. So, Tasty, you get a pass on the rice

Anyhow, I ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(I've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). I ordered the general tso's extra spicy - it was not. Also, the tofu was in very large chunks, which has seemed to be my luck lately. I want surface area, and I don't want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks. I will say, though, that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.

The eggroll, as I said, was tough.. It tasted good, but it was tough, and small... This probably won't be in my future order, however with the $10 minimum I do need to order something else with my tofu... I hope the soup is good.

Don't order the American standards of General Tso's and Moo Goo Gai Pan , unless you REALLY want to. This is the place to get really authentic home cooked food.

If you have an occasion, say a graduation dinner, the restaurant will even roast you a duck (yum!), or stir fry up some lobster with ginger and scallions ( big yum!) or stew you some pork with lotus root soup ( super yum!).

In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring.

The shelter itself is large and the volunteers and vet-techs that you interact with are very friendly.

Adoption is made easy unless you rent in which case you should probably bring a letter from your landlord stating you are allowed to adopt.

1172,BnBVuJgAUMm6dZQlSba8dg,ZzqIKc2HW1qp73fqGFnlyg,"This is an animal shelter with a tremendous heart. While I realize it's more popular to back the more selective (aka ""no-kill"") shelters around Pittsburgh, the ""open door"" policy places the ARL at the top of my list. Where the so-called no-kill shelters can afford to be choosy and accept all-star pets, the ARL will accept any pet, from a private owner, someone who finds a stray, or even the city's animal control. A small, over-extended staff collaborates with a dedicated troop of volunteers, and manages to adopt thousands and thousands of pets each year into family homes. 

I have adopted two cats from this shelter, and also participated in the adoption of several friends' pets here, too. The paid staff can be spread a little thin, especially if you come on a Friday afternoon/evening, or a weekend morning. Guess what, lots of people want to adopt a pet on the weekend when they have extra time to help it settle in. So don't be surprised to find crowds of potential adopters and exhausted staff!!! For a quieter experience, try a weekday. For the most intimate pet-finding experience, go during a Steelers game. Seriously, you will have the place to yourself. 

Is it sacrilegious to tell you to do anything during a Steelers game? Whoops. 

The ARL lists some of their pets on Petfinder, but I have found that the selection on the adoption floor is often too vast & quick moving for them to keep the profiles online updated -- what I'm trying to get at is this: Don't get super attached to a pet online, because there's a reasonable chance it already has a home. And don't avoid a trip because you don't see anyone you like online. There are more future fur-friends waiting for you at the shelter. 

The staff of volunteers is extraordinary - I adopted one of my cats directly out of a foster home, and the volunteer must have gone out of her way to come to the shelter at my convenience and explain all the in-home habits of my future baby. I had such a positive experience with her, and the shelter. They invite you to send updates and pictures as your new pet adjusts. Yes, the staff & volunteers have a vested interest in the pets and want to know how things go! 

The rates for adoption vary, depending on the season, so if your finances require some help to acquire your new best friend, keep an eye on their website for info about ""sales."" You can also donate old sheets, towels, pet carriers, and toys for the animals who stay here on their way to permanent homes. I donate a big pile of worn towels and sheets every time i sort my linen closet. They also accept ca$h donations to help keep up with expenses. 

Maybe I seem like an over-enthusiastic cheerleader of this place, but the fact is that this organization connected me with two very important cats in my life, and every scratch on my arms, every litter box, and every fur-covered outfit in my life is due credit to their tireless efforts.

Being a volunteer here has been so fulfilling on many different levels.  It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.  But the thing is, it's not.  It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic.  I rarely see animals there for a long time.  I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. 

Now I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter.  I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side.  They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter.  The cats are all set up in a huge room.  They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them.  These rooms are also used for ""cat cuddling.""  That's what I do when I volunteer.  I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around.  Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. 

The other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted.  This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have.  Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months.  The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.  It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. 

I would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend!  OR you can volunteer!  They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month.  After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer!

They get the animals the best vet care they can and i believe they have an on site clinic. I would suggest even if they have a special on adoption prices pay the full amount if you can.  From what I see they take great care of the animals and could use all the money they can to make sure this continues.,0,VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg,0,5,2011-10-18,review,0

As other reviewers have pointed out, going there both breaks and warms your heart.  I adopted my puppy, Brock, back in January, and I couldn't be happier.  The staff was super helpful and very kind. They gave us enough time to make sure Brock was the right dog for us, and also made sure we knew what we were getting ourselves into. (Brock is a husky mix, so he's a ball full of energy. Great running buddy! :) )

1183,zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA,4EzV9Q8Jn6C9B8YTIESx5w,"Animal Rescue League is great! BUT, I'm very disappointed by their dog trainer/behaviorialist, Lacey. 

I have a large papillon (a ""throwback"", as my vet called him), whose previous owners neglected and undersocialized him for the first two years of his life. As a result, he is now extremely fearful when taken outside the home, and he becomes overstimulated and aggressive. I brought him to one of ARL's Saturday small dog classes, but he freaked out, and we were asked to leave. Lacey said she'd be in contact to set up a private class. 

She called a few days later, and we arranged a private class for 6pm on a Wednesday. I made arrangements to leave work early to drive back into the city and get my pup some help! It's hard to anticipate exactly how much traffic there will be on Fifth Ave during rush hour, so I wound up playing it overly safe and arriving 10 minutes early for our class. 

After a few minutes, Lacey noticed us and came outside to tell me that she was running fifteen minutes behind. I wasn't sure what to do, because I couldn't really go anywhere with my cray-cray dog, and there was too much traffic to go home and come back again. So, she said we could wait inside in a small hallway. 

We went in to wait, and naturally, with all the smells and sounds, my pup got a bit riled up. But, we waited...and waited and waited. At 6:25pm, I knocked on the door to the training room. Silence. So, I opened it. Nobody was there, and the door to the outside was open. I peeked out, and there she was, with the people and dog that had the lesson before me. I waited for a moment, hoping she'd notice me and look at her watch or something, but nope.

So, I took my dog and walked outside to my car. She turned and looked at me, but didn't acknowledge me in any way. I went and sat in my car with my dog for a few minutes, hoping the other folks, their dog, and Lacey would wrap things up, but no. They just continued on. At 6:35pm, I knew I couldn't wait any longer, because I had work I still needed to finish up that had to be done by 9pm. I got out of my car, and began walking towards Lacey. She just stared at me, rather than saying ""We're just finishing up,"" or ""Sorry, I lost track of time,"" or anything at all. So I said, ""We're going to have to reschedule. It's past 6:30 now, and I can't stay past 7."" She simply replied, ""Okay. I'll call you."" 

I thought it was rude and unprofessional to not offer any type of apology, or even a half-hearted explanation, but whatever. No one said she had people skills, I suppose, and this was about getting my dog help! 

Well, it's been a week and a half. No call from Lacey! Needless to say, I'll be finding another, more reliable trainer. I'm just really disappointed, not only in her unprofessionalism, but also her lack of caring about my dog. I barely had any interaction with Lacey, but even if there was something about me she didn't like, she should have cared more about helping a pup that obviously needs it. 

I sincerely hope that others have had better experiences, and I hate to knock even a single star off for ARL -- but this Yelp review seems to be my only way of warning others to seek another trainer for their dog behavioral needs! :(",1,VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg,1,3,2012-08-15,review,4

After visiting every shelter in the city and finding nothing, we came back the next day after seeing a posting for a 2 month old terrier mix.

While struggling with my horrific grief and having difficulty getting back into life as I once knew it, my grief counselor suggested that I ""help something else"" in order to help myself feel better.  We decided that since I was an animal lover I would try volunteering at an animal shelter.  I was not working, so I had a lot of time and wanted the shelter to feel right.  I visited a few, they all do good work, but the one that kept drawing me back was the ARL.  Yes, the building is old, it's a bit run down, but that doesn't stop the staff and administration from doing the best they can with so very little and in not the best of space.  I saw a bathroom be ""renovated into a vet tech office, I saw the janitor's closet renovated and made in to the ""rodent room.""  Where cats once lived in cages along the halls of the ARL a new building next door, an old gas station was made into the ""Cat Adoption Center!""  When you have staff that are still young and are going on 5-10 years + at the same shelter, (same place of employment for that matter) you know something about the place is right!  I volunteer easily 30 hours a week at the ARL, I get to see the good, the bad and the ugly, and I can tell you first hand that the good is in the staff, the Executive Director, Dan Rossi, and all of the work that goes on for the animals.  The staff knows EVERY one of the animals, they do all they can to care for them, and keep the doors WIDE open for both domestic and wild animals, even if that means a staff member or volunteer takes a cat or dog home!  The answer is never ever ""no"" to any animal.  I also volunteer for the Humane Society of the United States and travel around the countryside working on dogfighting raids, cruelty, hoarding, natural disasters, and the ARL has never said no to me when I ask to bring animals back from incredibly sad or inhumane situations.  Technically, by the numbers, it is a ""no-kill"" shelter, because it is open door people will often call it a ""kill shelter.""  Yes, sometimes an animal does have to be euthanized.  The ARL is the Animal Control shelter for the city of Pittsburgh and with that can bring some very upsetting and disturbing signs of animal cruelty.  It can also mean it's the dog who just bit a kid that you just saw on the news.  The ARL has an obligation to society to not let dangerous dogs back on the street, to euthanize when a dog is very sick or is very aggressive to humans or other animals, and trust me, I have held many of those dogs as they are put to sleep and I always am so thankful that the vet staff we have are so compassionate and do the euthanasia in the most humane manner.  That's a tough job, it's heartbreaking, but in some cases it has to be done for the good of the animal and for the safety of society.  I admire the work and staff of the ARL and will continue to devote my time to them and thank them for the wonderful work they do on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh and all of the wild and domestic animals alike.

!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!

AKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.

I recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. 

Furthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?

So now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.

The Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. 

Had I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!

Oh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter!",1,VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg,1,1,2012-10-29,review,7

Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting.  A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter).  I contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues.  The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing.  In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly.  Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions.

I would highy suggest adopting from this shelter.

While browsing Facebook, I noticed that they were having an event at ARL.  This particular event was called the Free Fur All.  The event involved free adoption to qualified adopters, free micro-chipping for any pet (adopted there or elsewhere), free dog baths, and goodies for both human and furry companions.

I had plans to get Little Man E microchipped during his appointment to take his manhood away (don't worry, we've talked about it and he is fine by it), but when this popped up and said it was free.  Hot damn, you know I was in line.  It's also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in case they were to run off one night.

Once we were registered, we waited at most for 15 minutes.  It's a very quick thing to have done.  Little Man E didn't even flinch.  He was more amused by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade.  I have to give huge kudos to the staff there.  They are so very friendly to not only you, but your pet.  It's like they talk their language.  I also have to thank them because while we were there, LME somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could (no extra charge either!).

Once done, we just walked outside to see what was up (E skipped the bath).  We visited one of the tables and E selected a ball and bandanna and we decided to head out after that.

The primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.

Walking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy ""guilty-until-proven guilty"" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.

The pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.

The first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up ""maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.""  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.

The latest of many ""adventures"" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  

We then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they ""found"" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.  Hence, I am now here, writing this review.

-Two months later, I went to my Toyota dealership for routine maintenace. The dealer mechanic found that the lugnuts on the tires had been over torqued by Goodyear. So the Toyota mechanic had to saw them off of each tire and replace them with non-security locked nuts. (If I had a flat on the side of the road, I would have been SOL).

This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, ""There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?"" 

Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?

Let's go in order of importance:

Coffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. 

The coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. 

This is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. 

Pastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.

Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. 

Obviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, ""we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!"" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.

Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.",4,83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA,2,5,2008-05-26,review,7

A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. 

Tazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. 

They have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - ""we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different."" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. 

The lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the ""main drag"" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.",1,83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA,0,5,2008-09-14,review,2

I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.

It is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.

Enrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.

In addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.

Yes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  The patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  Anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.  

The noise level is perfect.  Most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  You don't need headphones to concentrate here.

Decor is decent without being great.  The ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  So is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  Where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.

Iced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. We tried their richly brewed Ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). Truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: Beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  The medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.

The food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten. Homemade pastries and fresh sandwiches looked tempting, and we certainly will come hungrier next time.

Yes, the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again.

Glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.

Tazza D'Oro is one of them. I wont say THE best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care Tazza D'Oro subscribes to. It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha.

I found out about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the US via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.

Their baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. They also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. Their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?

I have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well as another great coffee shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/",1,83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA,0,5,2011-02-16,review,5

Make no mistakes, I will finish any coffee drink from Tazza D'oro and at record speed. It is delicious to the very last drop and the best part is, they don't think that third degree burns go hand in hand with their coffee -- it's ready for drinking the moment you receive your order. Let's not forget about the food, which is also delicious. it's clear I have nothing bad to say about this establishment.

My girlfriend and I ordered lattes which were excellent--the space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin I would say the ones they had looked good.

Here's the thing...I don't like sweet! I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I just wanted a tiny bit of sweet, so I didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. I just got it plain.

I'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a Starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a ""REAL"" cappuccino tasted like. Please, I lived in Italy, I've had a ""REAL"" cappuccino...but right now, I want a flavor shot in it. I still tipped because I wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place, and he did offer to make me something different. I just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not ""allowed"" to add them to your drink?

Probably just a mistake, so we reasoned that this place deserved a second chance. The next time around, we order a pair of cappuccinos, one with vanilla --

Now, before I go any further, I recognize that cappuccinos are typically made without sugar or added flavoring. I have also been to a ton of neighborhood coffee shops, have heard the question ""wet or dry"" a thousand times. Sometimes a ""wet cap"" is really what you're hoping for in a latte. And even when it's not, like most people, I don't snark or complain when someone gives me a cup that isn't quite what I was hoping for. I usually end up liking it anyways. My taste buds aren't that delicate.

Perhaps you can see where I'm going with this story. Vanilla cappuccino. I get it, it's not something that's done. But when someone asks you for something you don't sell, just explain the situation politely. If you feel the need to snark, share knowing glances, or anything along those lines, just stifle it. Trust me, I've seen many professionals perform better with requests far more ridiculous. There's really never any need for snobbery. So I've got to dock Tazza d'Oro a bit.

Make sure you go with a bunch of guys, because it isn't all you care to eat, it is a challenge.  You have to eat all you can eat and your ego is on the line if you don't.  I once went to Ribs night and one buddy of mine ordered a Buffalo Chicken salad when everyone else ordered ribs.  Yea, he regretted his terrible decision.

Anyways.  The food itself.  The ribs are basic baby back ribs that come in a choice of mild, medium, and hot bbq sauce.  I tend to just go medium, b/c I find a hot bbq sauce covers up the taste of the meat itself, and when I eat ribs I care more about the taste and texture of the actual meat with the sauce being a supporting player.  The ribs are ok for mass produced ribs, nothing spectacular.  The most I've done is only two racks of ribs, but that was only because I didn't want to keep everyone else waiting up for me.  Ribs come in a rack in first round, and then re-orders come by the half rack.

Personally I prefer wing night, as they have fantastic wings.  Wings come in a dozen in the first round, followed by half dozen reorders until you're done.  They have 12 different flavors, but my favorite ones are Buffalo Blue, Old Yeller, and Red Hot Parm.  Buffalo Blue is a tasty bbq sauce that isn't overly sweet like some of their other bbq sauces, Old Yeller is a Carolina Mustard based sauce, and Red Hot Parm is a traditional Buffalo sauce (Frank's Red Hot + Butter) then topped with Parmesan Cheese.  Their Cool Ranch, Garlic Parm, and Spicy Garlic can be a bit greasy, so if you do order one of those make sure its in a batch of 6 and you share with your friends, I kind of like their Spicy Garlic, but no one else ever wants to split an order with me, oh well.  Their Gold Rush and Death Row are their two other non-spicy bbq sauces, but I prefer Buffalo Blue to both of them.

For their spicy flavors, there's Red Hot, which is just a traditional Buffalo, there's Howlin' Wolf, which is a spicy sour sauce with pepper seeds on it, and there's Hotter than Hell, which is a spicy bbq sauce.  Personally I find Howlin' Wolf tasty in small quantities, but sometimes the sourness gets to me.  I tend to find spicy bbq sauces a bit funky, so I'm not big on Hotter than Hell.

If I have a big appetite I eat from 24-30 wings.  If its just a regular day I'll eat around 18-22ish wings.

Note: These wings are huge.  They aren't your typical Wingzone or Quaker Steak and Lube sized wings.  These are real wings from real chickens, not some little baby chicks just hatched from their eggs.

The rest of the menu is just typical American restaurant food with various sandwiches, a burger option, salad options, etc.

I tried a medium spicy sauce (instead of jumping right to hotter 'n hell) because I was sick with anticipation for the steelers game, and it was nice and sweet and not bland.  

Predicting a healthy selection of nachos and other cheese drenched options at the steeler game, I had a salad.  I expected it to be sad and pathetic, as salads at wing joints often are, but it was really good!  The lettuce was not all nearly white grossness, the other veggies were nice and crisp, and the toppings were great!

We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.

For dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.

The bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.",0,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,0,2,2012-01-30,review,1

We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought.  It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.

I went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  The sandwich left something to be desired.  It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  It was just belly-filler, really.  I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here.  

I just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8.  Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home.  Buffalo Blues was neither.

1321,sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg,rmxydx4rmbOPwrM5iOlqpQ,"The best thing about Buffalo Blues revolves around Sundays during football season. For me, personally, it's one of the best places to catch an NFL game...especially if you're not a Steelers fan. On any given Sunday, you'll find fans of just about every team in the NFL taking in a game, so the atmosphere is a positive one. Seating is the only issue. Get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game, as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin. Luckily, the TV's (there are lots of them) are all labeled with the day's matchups, so finding the game you're looking for isn't a problem.

The draft beer selection usually has something for everyone, from local craft brews by East End Brewing, to seasonals and your simpler standards (hello, PBR), so if you're a beer person, you won't be disappointed.

As far as service goes, it's hit-or-miss. I've had mostly great service at the bar, but I've also had average to below average service at tables. During bigger sporting events - primarily Steelers games - the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar area.

Overall, I have to rate the food as average. I LOVE their boneless wings, and their wing sauces are all very excellent. Their pulled pork is really tender and delicious, as well, but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average. The fries can be either really good, or too soggy and greasy. I think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue. The menu reads really well, which raises your expectations, but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed. It's never horrible, but you'll rarely be blown away by your meal.

In the end, I'm giving Buffalo Blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events, which, let's face it, is the real draw of a ""sports bar."" As far as sports bars go, it's my favorite place to catch a game. They always get a good crowd for games (whether Sundays during the NFL season, Saturdays during big college games, or for Pens games), and if you stick to the wings and beer, odds are your experience will be great. There's a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if you're an out-of-towner looking for a game, and the crowd is much more accepting, friendly, and relaxed than the crowds I've experience in other sports bars in town. Most of my average experiences revolved around non-game times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in Shadyside for lunch and dinner.",1,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,1,3,2012-02-28,review,1

I was mainly interested in seeing Madonna. I do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. We had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. 

The food was pretty blah in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was ""EH"". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn't like it at all. Bad texture. The commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but I wouldn't go back to eat. Just drinks and sports. I like the location. Easy to park. Close to shadyside.

1324,3h4VbpuqlZeVCSuqq9bdeQ,RibII_r2z-lPukxDwaNGeg,"So, I went to Buffalo Blues tonight for the second time (not the second time tonight, the second time in my life) for dinner and some drinks, and to sum up my experience in a few words, both times it was about what I expected.  Just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.

I'll start with the drinks.  They have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though I didn't have a look at it, so I can't judge; and the Happy Hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5PM-7PM).   Plus they have East End drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of Big Hop (the only East End choice they have) when I was there (I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it).  The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.

The menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and Southwestern-themed foods from which I picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.  Although at the end I was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble.  The meal overall  was good, and since I got it with the happy hour special, I can't complain.  One thing I will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (I'm not vegetarian, but I try not to eat too much meat, so I notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, I would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.

I know I haven't said much negative about Buffalo Blues in this review, yet I'm still giving it only three stars.  This is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the ""word versions"" of the ratings that Yelp gives us.  ""A-OK,"" which, if you didn't know, is how Yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how I would describe Buffalo Blues.  The comparison I keep going to in my head is Die Hard 2.  It's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something I'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.

To sum it up - I'm not a big sports guy.  Buffalo Blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (I'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the Steelers-Ravens I watched at Big Jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life).  And, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but ""just fine.""

Food is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! 

The ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your ""space"" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called ""party room"" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.

Want to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!

The ""wonderful"" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, ""Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!"" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).

The food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!

My husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.

The bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.

She came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.

Twenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work.

Buffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.

My friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  

I chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold.

1339,5gi8yR20fvnim2dg3n-MpQ,KydWlGaGat9R15Po2T7Ocg,"I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  

I love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding.  I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.  

However, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't.  Not even a little bit.  The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So, it's not really much of a win at all.  Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.",0,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,0,2,2014-01-13,review,0
1340,vcZFBFe-nF60JmwIbJ1f2Q,cTZcCCmBaZaQAcDgqWLzbg,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.

They tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.

The food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entrée, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entrée salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie burger every Sunday for 17 weeks.  It gets old.  Fast.

Upshot?  In the absence of a new sports bar opening up, we'll be back next season, but not before then.",0,Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg,0,3,2014-01-13,review,0

Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one.

I have had quite a few things in the menu but two things that I love more than others are the cobb salad and the Oscar's Garbage burger. 
     The cobb salad is just a cob salad, but some how they make it better than most. I don't know if it's the sprout or the dressing, but it is one of the best cobb salads I have ever had. 
     And the garabge burger....Mmmmmmm. This burger caught my attenetion at first because it has an egg on it. I lovelovelove a burger with an egg on it.  I don't know what genuis started the egg on a burger trend, but kudos to you!
But that's not all. Imagine a Primanti's sandwich but with a big, fat burger. It has fries, cole slaw, an egg and American cheese. My BF often comments it's strange there's no bacon, but honestly, that'd be over kill. 

They also have a really good veggie sandwich with Hummus (I don't remember the name), a great buffalo chicken sandwich and fantastic appitizers. 

Also, it's worth mentioning they hace really good hand cut fries- not those mushy frozen crap sticks- and GREAT fresh homemade potato chips.

We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture.

1372,pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ,dUSee9yB_JaU2_dloh1nMA,"I came in with a flat.  They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.  The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.

Coincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.  Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?

Well, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).  Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480.  How did I know they were crappy?  I looked them up online.  Guess what else I found.  Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal!  

So no, no thank you.  I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.

Fortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.  They fixed the flat no problem for $20.  Guess that cracking wasn't so bad after all.",1,t15LDNaHFpu-bAEJSdoV-g,1,1,2012-06-27,review,1

I may not know much about cars but I know how to search the internet and ask for advice. I found the cost of wheel hubs, they are no more than $150 each (for my car) and here they said that they cost $550 each (before labor).

In March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. The second tire was fine but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. Put the tires in my basement, no problem. Saved for a rainy day. 

This week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable so I had to get it replaced. Luckily I've got a spare!

I needed my car so I took it to pep boys (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). 

I drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. 

After paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they ""would work with me"". Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? Not worth chancing. Because you couldn't fit me in within a day I get screwed?

Last time I brought it in I asked him if I should put more money into the car- the alternator was out and a new battery was needed.  The car would not start.  He told me it is a good time to get a new car because he wan't sure how much more this car could take.  He even gave me a couple of numbers of guys who buy cars ""as is.""  I called these guys and sold this beater maxima for $1000 as is!

The ""office"" must be very messy and grease and dirt must be everywhere.  

In my opinion, if an auto shop has the time and money to keep a squeaky clean appearance, they're wasting some of your money you pay for service.  Walter's Automotive fits the bill with their ""office"" being a small cluttered desk in the service bay.  Their ""lobby"" is the doorway that you stand in just outside the ""office.""  I couldn't be happier with my first impressions--to me, minimal overhead means maximum service and value.

Sure enough everyone at Walter's is very nice and helpful.  Apparently, everyone else in Pittsburgh knows this since I have to schedule an appointment 10 days in advance just to get my car inspected.

From there you don't have to worry about anything. On my particular car I always have to fix the suspension, and I ended up needing the same repair from last year.

I was pretty blown away by that considering the other place I go to is just as down to earth as Walter's.

Walters took the time to put my tennis racquets in my trunk and remove my aftermarket stereo so they wouldn't be seen. He explained everything to me thoroughly and was really friendly when I came to pick up my car.

You absolutely do need to call a few weeks ahead and be patient. Quality service takes some time. 

Now that I am moving to the opposite side of the country, I took my car in one last time to get everything checked out, fixed, swapped out etc. My car was in the shop for 3 days and I waited patiently knowing that I can trust Tim and Arlene in the same way I can trust my parents to get something important done. They aren't there to screw you over. I know this because I had, on my first occasion taking my car there, gotten a second opinion on somethings and everything aligned between the two sources so they earned my trust! 

They took care of me and my car really well. Arlene kept me up to date on what was going on and Tim took the time to explain what the parts were, what they did and how much things were going to cost. He even sat with me after closing hours researching the oxygen sensor and tires I needed online and quoting me the best price. He listed out everything I needed to have done and told me which was most important for a cross country drive and what could wait. That is service and care!! 

If you need a great mechanic, like you need a good doctor, be patient, be inquisitive and do a little bit of planning. Your car will get serviced, your wallet will be in good shape and you might learn a bit about the car you drive. I only hope to find as good of a business in Seattle as I did here in Pittsburgh.

My appointment was made for two weeks in advance but Tim had me bring my car in and we took it for a test drive. Tim determined that it was the Cat converter and recommended that I not drive the vehicle very much as to not cause further damage. Tim said that he and one of his mechanics were going to work extra hours that weekend to get caught up and that he would try to get to my vehicle. So I dropped my car off on Wed night, on Thursday Tim called with an estimate that was 150.00 to 200.00 less than what others had quoted. 

I expected my car to be worked on over the weekend however at the end of Thursday Tim called and told me that my car was ready and running great! Wow! I was surprised and grateful. 

When I picked up my car on Friday the cost for repairs was 15.00 less than my original quote due to a gasket that was included with the part and not ordered separate.

Then, when he diagnoses your car, he'll explain it to you like you're not an idiot, and he'll make sure you understand what's going on. He's incredibly honest and cares about his customers. For instance, once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in, then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it, and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it.

Beyond the facility you get to the actual 'poorly executed' idea.  The staff is extremely un-knowledgeable about the subjects they are producing.  For instance none of the programmers on staff have any training in performing arts, they are all visual arts people playing at another field.  As a result they don't even know what they are really producing and any experienced person in the field can tell.  

The sad part about this is they REALLY try.  They throw staff and new ideas at every opportunity.  Don't expect great performances here, expect a talked up mediocre performance.

A nice marriage of creamy, rich, and sweet. Loved this delight. I also had a tasty cupcake. The cake was not as rich as that in the tulip. Yet, the frosting was a divine passion fruit. Yum.

I recently moved from TN and needed to transfer my title and register my Dodge Ram in PA.  This process is costly regardless of where you go, but adding $36+ for every transaction makes AAA the most expensive.  I'm willing to pay for people to deal with this inconvenience for me, but AAA has made it worse than going to the DMV.  Each and every clerk at this location is incompetent, uneducated, and aloof. I should know, I've dealt with at LEAST a dozen. Go to the DMV.

For my very simple transaction, I've had to return to this location 7 (yes that is SEVEN!) times, and it still is not resolved. They've forgotten to request the title from my lien holder, issued the wrong plate for my vehicle, neglected to inform me of steps required by the state... I mean seriously, why would you pay $36 for EACH visit, just to get it wrong. Go to the DMV!

Why did you return there if you were so unhappy, you might ask.  Well once you begin the process at one branch, you cannot transfer to any other branch. (We went to Monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go to Monroeville, or cancel your AAA membership and go to the DMV!!

It was pouring down rain, but I put on my rainboots, grabbed an umbrella, and hoofed it over to ye ole Home Depot.  I had to stand over the shoulders of five--yep, I counted five--employees in appliances for a full minute before one of them would help me.

After someone directed me to the vacuum parts, I had two male employees stop by to see if I needed help as I searched for the correct belt.  I had the vacuum's name and number written down, as well as the belt style, and had the actual busted belt with me.  Yet, each of these men acted like I was some stupid girl.  ""Did you unplug the vacuum before you removed the old belt?"" one asked me.  Duh.  I'm not an idiot.  The other later asked, ""Do you always wear bright yellow rainboots when you're doing repairs?"" and snickered.  Look, all I said to both gentlemen was ""I'm just looking for the correct style number.  But thanks.""

I received similar treatment I stopped by to buy a new set of bits for my drill.  ""You know drills come in more than one kind, right?"" I was asked.

Occasionally I do need to go to Monroeville to find specific items, however. With a 1920s house, I spend quite a bit of time here for getting materials for repairs.

Customer service is about average. Some people are very helpful, others not so much. In general, they seem to be better than the Lowes at the Waterfront. At least HD people know where items are in the store. I can't tell you how many times I've received completely different (and wrong) answers to finding stuff at Lowes.

I would prefer a small hardware store (such as an Ace) closer to me for things like nuts, bolts, and screws. Ace seems to have a better selection than HD does for hard-to-find items. HD has most of the basics covered, however, and probably a little cheaper.

I generally avoid their paint section except for equipment. I prefer the service at a Sherwin-Williams or Masterwork Paint store. 

We've had decent luck with their garden department. We've had to return a few plants that died the day after we planted them, but they have never given us any problems with returns.

My only regret is that I didn't get a peace lily while I was there.   

I purchased my first ever air conditioner and I'm happy I did so at The Home Depot. I have terrible luck with appliances. In my experience no matter how much I pay , be it $30 or $ 300.00 my appliances always seem to stop running right after the manufactures warranty expires.  So I opted for the additional year of coverage which cost peanuts. I believe the additional protection it was less then $15.00 dollars.  

To this day I find it funny that my hubby and I purchased THE LAST PORTABLE AC the store had, remember guys this was last February. So apparently there was a run on ACs last winter.   Anyway it's still working great even after I dropped a screw inside of it on accident and I'm happy with my purchase.

I enjoy building, maintaining and fixing things in my own home as opposed to hiring a contractor and paying a boat load. I'm best known at the Home Depot in monroeville.

They allow pets i'm assuming because i've never been asked to leave and I've seen others with their pets as well. 

That's the best part about the store is the animal policy and the fact that they offer enough supplies for you to practically build a house. Some things are cost efficient while others are kinda breaking the bank. There not as modern as lowes but they have alot of the same products.

I really felt like I was in a home depot commercial with the friendly workers explaining their products to you and helping you make smart selections.

Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not ""qualified"" for delivery to the store.

Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really?

We were excited to get there as the event said we would be making something, there would be food and music, demonstrations, live music, and a gallery.  Booking our reservations for 6pm was quick and easy over the phone; $60 for a couple.  Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something.  In the end, we chose not to spend the extra $15 to make another garden float/ornament; aka a hollow glass ball.  

When our 'instructor' met with us, he was very friendly but it was loud and he was very hard to hear.  He ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end, all we got to do was blow air in a tube for 10 seconds.  Had the first attempt not popped, I wouldn't even have been able to do anything!  From a teacher's standpoint, there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in; I would've been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue.  Within 15 minutes, our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turn.

We then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer, wine, sparkling juices, veggies, fruit, cheese, and some deli meats.  The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm.

The gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch.

In the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!).  It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals).

I figured I'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  I opted for the Popcorn Chicken Salad.  Sounds tasty, looked tasty, and yes it even tasted tasty.  Iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, and three types of cheese.  

I have to say that even though I was saying yes, my body was saying, 'OH hell no!'

I'm regretting this decision now as I am sitting here in discomfort.  Not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  But I'm not liking the effect I'm getting right now.  Could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.

We'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment, and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze.  My friend suggested getting pizza from here, and I didn't object, since I'd never had pizza from here before, and I'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent.

The pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it, right about at the time estimated, so no complaints there.  As for the pizza itself, it was solidly A-OK--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was a bit on the greasy side, and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  As for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was more greasy than I'd like, but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so).

But their pizza was remarkably terrible.

Went there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a ""personal"" pie, costs $7 and is 7"" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a ""small,"" which is 10"". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.

There are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.

The friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, ""I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good."" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10"" pizza is, and started eating.

Let me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, ""well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine."" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, ""it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.""

I ate three out of the six ""slices."" (One sixth of a 10"" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.

Ashamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.

Went home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.

I know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh.",0,B9C6j80ob0f1pwi1Cnnd1Q,0,1,2014-12-16,review,1

I attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back.  

So I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review).

True, the parking lot is a mess, but I attribute that more to:
a) People not knowing how to drive. Because you CAN drive to the back of the parking lot, park, and get inside in half the time it takes to sit in line like a moron who doesn't understand how to drive AROUND a car waiting to park.... and

If the zucchinis at Market District looked a little weak, give Whole Foods a try. Plus their pre-made food is actually yummy.

I am one of the lucky ones, I know of a few people who weren't so lucky. 

I'm a huge fan of the salad and hot bar - not a fan of the price though. To be fair, I can only blame myself for ending up with an $11 salad (but everything is so good and actually fresh I can't stop myself from piling it on). The prepared sandwich's are pretty awesome too and if you go after 9p, they are buy 1 get 1.

Considering this, I'll veer from describing their products and cut to my pros and cons.

Pros:
Lots of natural (and not so natural sometimes--still need to check your labels) health and beauty products in one spot.
Impressive amount of otherwise hard to find items in these areas: grains, olives, cheeses, organic meat, organic produce, international dry goods, teas, non-HFCS drinks.
Friendly staff who are knowledgeable, or willing to track down the right person to help if you have questions about a product.

Cons:
The parking lot could never be big enough. Look for the song about this on youtube; it is true of all Whole Foods.
The vegetarian selection for the food bar has sunk really low in the past 6 months (fewer options, what is there sits out too long and isn't fresh, items that the do make aren't as good as items they removed from menu).
The food bar is super expensive...for a food bar.
Across the board, prices are too expensive for all products.

As for the three star rating, no Whole Foods will ever wow me. If you are looking for a shop to be impressed with that is similar, look to the models of 17th Street Market in Tucson, AZ or Berkeley Bowl in Oakland, CA. They do basically the same stuff and more, all for a lot less money. In Tucson, I bought strictly organic groceries and you can purchase almost twice as much fresh produce for the same price. I'll use the Whole Foods because I haven't found a good alternative in Pittsburgh, but that doesn't mean I have respect for it like the other places I named.",0,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,3,2011-11-26,review,0
1591,-Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw,2VM_YjgIdoLl7hrs7Ne_jA,"What's the most dangerous area in Pittsburgh--the Hill District? Homewood? Garfield? Wrong. it's the Whole Foods parking lot. Since I drive a Mini Cooper, it's considerably easier for me to zip around and dodge the Lexus SUVs that fly at you from every angle in this jungle of a parking lot, but I'm not sure how you people with normal-sized cars do it. Compounding the problem are the abandoned shopping carts rolling about and sometimes filling the already-limited parking spaces, thanks to the shortage of shopping cart corrals. Cold and tired, I found myself seriously considering abandoning my cart when I noticed that the nearest corral was on the other side of the lot. Don't worry, I didn't succumb to the temptation, but judging by the state of the parking lot, I think I'm in the minority.

If you actually make it into the store without any physical injury (you will be psychologically scarred, trust), there's definitely some good stuff to be had. As others have noted, the store is really small, causing the selection to be less than extensive. It's also too crowded. I like to spend a lot time in the grocery store checking out what's new and reading labels and such, but I feel awkward doing that when there's a swarm of soccer moms lurking over my shoulder and zigging and zagging all over the goddamn place. ANYWAY...some notes on various departments:

1. The produce here immediately stands out--it looks so much more appetizing and fresh than at Giant Eagle. Even the bagged salad greens are more vibrant. Unfortunately, it's a tradeoff for the smaller selection of produce, but they have all the basics covered.

2. This past trip was the first time I bought meat from Whole Foods, and the cuts were noticably neater and more consistent than at GE. Not sure if this is a regular thing, but they didn't have any filet mignon (I know, I'm high maintenance. I'M WORTH IT!).

3. The cheese department! I like how GE Market District organizes their cheese a little better, but Whole Foods has a much more interesting and varied selection.

5. The food bar is hit or miss. Some days it's the best thing ever, other days not so much. The sushi is gross. I always seem to forget this and try it over and over again with the same fishy, mealy results. Don't be stupid like me, avoid it.

6. Market District recently got rid of a lot of their natural & organic chip selection in favor of more varities of their store brand. Thankfully, Whole Foods has everything GE used to have and more, which totally makes the extra shopping trip worth it. If you're a fat kid like me, that is...

I don't come here for everything, but there are definitely some advantages here. Plus, the prices here are not THAT much worse than Market District in most cases. And I have no idea how I just wrote so much about Whole Foods?",2,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,1,4,2011-12-09,review,1
1592,yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q,Kq-PU2_IdpF6ULOFfSrmUA,"I have a soft spot for Whole Foods.  I think it gets a bad rap, which I think is largely unfair.  I love food, and I know that sometimes things are legitimately ""overpriced,"" but just because something is expensive doesn't mean it isn't worth the cost.  So I don't believe in rating Whole Foods low just because their organic produce, ethically raised meat, and super hard-to-find ethnic ingredients cost money.  Nice things cost money.

This is not one of the glorious meccas - the Whole Foods in Lincoln Park in Chicago is definitely one of those - but this one is all right.  Pretty decent produce selection, and they always have some fun, mysterious finds.  I like their seasonal treats like meyer lemons, and their well-priced organic local produce throughout the summer.  Small fish and meat counter, but the quality is excellent.  My coworkers love the soups, and we all really enjoy the salad bar.  I love that I can find really unusual things here - their Asian section is small, but they always seem to have what I need.  And the prices on the Whole Foods store brand are really not that bad!  Seriously, like a can of beans will only set you back 99 cents, not that different from your Giant Eagle.  You can find affordable products here if you take the time.

I wish their bulk section was bigger, and I wish they had bulk spices because those make my life amazing.  Whole Foods is like, where I want to do all my shopping when I grow up.  I hate shopping at Giant Eagle, because there's no love and respect for the product.  It's just crap, and OVERPRICED crap spilling out of the aisles, begging for your attention.  Whole Foods has a lot of specialty products, made and sold by people who love to eat, and love to cook.  There's respect for the ingredients here.  To me, that's the best sign of a good grocery store.

If you don't have a lot of cash, like me, then it's good to only shop here when you need to (like for a weird cut of meat, some kind of unusual hot pepper or mushroom, flavored oil, rare cheese).  Every time you come, buy something new, just for fun.  There are so many surprises here!  I just wish it was bigger.

Cuz let's face it, how could I seriously compare this location to the original, gigantic, amazing, fresh, wonderful, healthy, gorgeous Whole Foods in Austin? Instead, I'll limit myself on reviewing the ever so friendly staff and parking lot. 

First, the employees. I've been to several Whole Foods around the country and I always got the impression that Whole Foods prides itself on customer service. Maybe this place is the exception? I was shopping here yesterday and a lady kindly asked an employee if she could squeeze in behind his veggie cart to grab something. The employee actually had the audacity to say, ""When I'm done"". And he did just that. He finished stocking his fruits and veggies and when he moved his cart and the lady thanked him, he didn't say a word. Also, the lady bagging my groceries didn't say one word to me. Not when I said hello. Not when I said thank you. Not even an ""ok"" when I said have a nice day. She didn't even smile at me! Where is the love? Actually, where are your manners?  I don't need you to love me, but don't be rude or ignore me. 

Second, the parking lot. I'm pretty sure this is the only Whole Foods in all of Pittsburgh. However, the parking lot seems to be built for Pittsburgh, population: 50. It's a small lot - good luck finding a spot without creepily following someone to their car and fighting an SUV for the spot. Luckily, I've never truly had a problem parking because I go at off times and park farther away. But I'm suspecting one of these days I'll come out and find my car dented or scratched. Maybe by a car, maybe by a shopping cart......maybe by the lady who was bagging my groceries yesterday....

So two stars docked for the above mentioned.  Other than that, I'll keep shopping here - after all, it's not like I have another choice when it comes to the Whole Foods of PIttsburgh.",2,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,1,3,2012-01-05,review,5

Okay, I'm going to a negative place right now....

I stop in here one a whim when I'm out in the area if I'm really craving sushi, because it's way better than the Giant Eagle's sushi down the street.

Many Yelpers have docked stars for the parking lot. I think that's irrelevant. The parking lot, which is actually shared by Starbucks, Wine & Spirits, Walgreens, PNC, and more is two levels and is enormous! Walk a little. You can even take your cart up the elevator.

The Pittsburgh location is not a superstore. Other Whole Foods have a restaurant, brick oven pizzas, smoothie bar, coffee bar, many more food bars, wine, beer, and so forth. This is a teeny weeny Whole Foods. For its size, the selection is pretty impressive. For example, my mom saw something on Dr. Oz called Lingonberry Jam and asked if I would look for it, and there it was. Never heard of it before, but they had it. 

Whole Foods has that ""whole paycheck"" reputation. Granted, this is true if you're spending your whole paycheck on rare, gourmet, specialty foods! If that's the case, you might want to rein in your spending a little. 

I actually took a notebook to Trader Joe's, Giant Eagle, and Whole Foods when I first moved to Pittsburgh to compare prices. Giant Eagle (Greenfield location) was the most expensive by an overwhelming margin! Trader Joe's was the best value overall, but Whole Foods was very close, and sometimes a little better quality might be worth it. Their 365 brand is especially reasonable for your regular grocery staples.

I've been brushed on the leg and knee multiple times by cut-throat drivers in that parking lot.  I believe they would park INSIDE the store if they could).
I don't complain about the prices, because the food, and health benefits, are worth it in the long-term.  Not so long ago, I was forking out hundreds of dollars a month in prescription medications because my diet was HORRIBLE.  Since making the decision over two years ago to be more active and eat solely organic and Non-GMO, I'm off all of my medications, and the price of organic food is NOTHING compared to medications and prescriptions.  I'm actually saving money.  And No, I don't even make $20K a year - so it's all about choices.  I'm not ""rich"" at all, like most people assume, since I regularly shop there.  In fact, I'm usually dead broke.  But to me, eating whole and healthy and protecting my body is not a luxury, it's a necessity.
I also like that there is no pharmacy in Whole Foods.  That should say something.
My love for Whole Foods resides in the Organic Salad Bar, and Prepared Foods section.  Their salad bar is so fresh and so delicious, that eating salads anywhere else becomes TASTELESS.  Organic makes all the difference.
My favorite Prepared Foods is their Vegan General Tso's ""chicken"".  Little popcorn nuggets of Seitan, drenched in the best General Tso's sauce I've ever tasted, with steamed broccoli.  Molly's Sesame Noodles on the salad bar is our favorite side dish to this prepared foods treat.  I swear we eat it at least once a week.
We also love their Bulk Section where we can get bulk quinoa, granola, lentils, and all kinds of things for a really decent price.  
The secret to shopping at Whole Foods?   BUY WHAT YOU NEED TO EAT THAT DAY.  It's not smart to bulk shop organic produce, because it goes bad faster.  Buy what you KNOW you're going to eat.  You won't see 10/$10 deals, because the food isn't crap, and you're not supposed to stockpile fresh foods.  You're supposed to eat it when it's fresh.  And buy your dry stock at Trader Joe's or the East End Food Co-Op.

The food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+

The employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen ""workers"" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating ""We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask"" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!

The other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!

So unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?

I'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk.",1,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,3,1,2012-05-12,review,2

You pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right? Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the atrocious parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it.

I'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.

Upon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.

And that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.

If you actually try to price compare between GE and whole foods, you'll find that whole foods is actually cheaper, and the only reason you don't shop there is because people will feed you into thinking you'll spend your ""whole paycheck"" there.  What crap.  Write a list, prioritize and buy the things that are sale.  Whole foods has a much better selection (freshness wise) in produce, meats, and cheese across the board.  Yes you can find some great stuff in the strip, but you will also find some reasonable items here.  Over the summer I went on a scavenger hunt for clams, Wholeys/GE were both gross and overpriced!

From that perspective this place just gets two stars.  Some items were higher priced but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I guess justify it if you had to have it.  But the items that do no fall under any of those premium-restriction value types are still just as highly priced.

After I taught a yoga class.  I know, I know, I'm such a white liberal yuppie, it's painful.

The meat, seafood and vegetables always look fresh and last a whole lot longer than the stuff from Trader Joes or Market District. Plus you don't have to look at the label for any of the ingredients cause you know the food does not have corn syrup or a derivative of it.

I docked two stars for absolutely terrible parking - yep. I know that's harsh, but every time we come here, we need to factor in another 10-15 minutes to get a parking spot and be able to leave safely (there are always cars behind us looking for a spot when we are trying to leave, and so we often can't just pull out of the space and leave quickly...)

Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing.

Of course, if you're at Whole Foods your'e likely there for the organic options, and as to be expected, you're not going to find a better selection anywhere else. More unique, perhaps, but their inventory just won't be matched any time soon for those foods.

I will state it outright that I'm very particular about my food, and I've been known to stomp my food like a brat when my heart's set on that vegan tofu burrito from the fresh pack section and it's not available. 

A few months ago, when this happened, I sulked at the Prepared Foods counter, and Bethany, prepared foods customer service extraordinaire, flew to my rescue. She suggested the vegan BLT. I was hesitant, as I wanted something hearty and filling, and let me tell you this!... The sandwich totally did her smile and sales pitch justice. It pleased me like no other sandwich has ever done. I want to compliment every sandwich maker in that department, specifically Bethany, Eric, and Rick. They know when I walk in their direction from the Fresh Pack section that I'm looking for my second option of the BLT because the burrito isn't available. No matter how bananas and certifiably insane I might seem during my food shopping excursions, they always treat me with such dignity and respect.

Months have passed since my first BLT experience, and I was completely taken for another ride through satisfaction land during this past week when they offered to notify me ""the night before when the vegan tofu burritos are being made"" because they know how much I have my heart set on that beautiful meal on most days of the week. I can't say enough for Bethany and her team of prepared foods colleagues. 

And everyone else at the store is so helpful and nice, too! So kind! So informative! I love Whole Foods Market of Pittsburgh! AND, for icing on the review cake, they've even begun to carry Brad's Raw Pizza Kale Chips for dogs. So my dog is satisfied, too. And it's her opinion that ultimately matters. ;) Five stars!

I think: if I made at least twice the amount of money I currently do, I would be able to be a member of the club and shop here. .... but I don't. Thus, I only stop in here on very special occasions when I 1. can withstand the rage I feel when I pull into this parking lot; and 2. I want to either eat at the buffet or buy a very specific item. I would definitely recommend that others stop in sometime to get some food at the buffet.

Staff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. 

The cashiers here are so fantastic. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. 

Deli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! 

The tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. 

Cheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. 

Store Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. 

Whole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. 

P.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here!",4,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,2,4,2014-07-07,review,2

1633,C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA,enWLsxACY6BciN1nJO9Ehg,"My expectations for Whole Foods Market had been established as was growing up in the DMV (D.C., MD, VA) area. Thus, very fresh produce, high-quality meats, diverse cheeses, expansive bulk section, novel food items, exceptional food bars, and excellent customer service were essentially a given. On the other hand, I also expected parking difficulties, even at stores with multi-story garages.

The Whole Foods Market in Pittsburgh is not much different from those in the DMV area. However, the parking is horrendous! Really, a medium-size private parking lot for the only Whole Foods Market in the Pittsburgh area right along a congested major road? Let me say that Whole Foods Markets in D.C. are also close to major roads, but they at least have underground or aboveground garages and fairly decent road infrastructure to accommodate for the influx and outflux of shoppers. I would love if the Pittsburgh store can build a garage of some sort (I'm not counting the garage next to the Starbucks and Walgreens) with smooth entry and exit so as to prevent a mini-gridlock along Centre Avenue.

Parking situation aside, the Pittsburgh store does live up to my expectations established from the DMV stores. You will rarely find a bad apple (no pun intended), and the store usually keeps shelves stocked (except when there is a major sale or promotion going on). Now, if only its prices and my budget could meet halfway so I could frequent this store more--via bike or my own two feet.",0,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,3,2014-09-14,review,0

Then after you find a parking spot from doing bumper cars with other non-driving asses. Here comes another traffic jam (carts, and people). The space in there is one big box. Geez Louise. 

I cringe when I have to go there to get an item that only WF carries. But I like how they trap me with their delicious fruit and vegetable display as soon as you walk in. It's a war zone in that area. I can understand organic being more expensive than conventional, but why oh why is their conventional JUST AS expensive as their organic? REALLY?!?! So every time they get me with their fruits, veggies, and the only place that I have found to sell skinless drumsticks, along with 2 or 3 more items. My bill is ALWAYS 90.00!! OMG!!

I would say everything I got from the salad bar to the hot bar was good apart from they had run out of soup/special of the day and the chicken was beyond dry, the time I spent in the dessert was a wet oasis compared to the chicken. I just feel that for the price I paid it was not worth it. I have been to a smaller whole foods with a better hot bar and to the one in New York City and remember it being great. I only give this one 3 stars because the Mac n cheese and vegan tofu loaf was rather good. But I must repeat myself about the price. For what I got it's way to much. It's hard to justify paying that much when I could make it for 1/5th the price at home.

But that parking lot.  Good Lord it's like playing bumper cars.  And from the YouTube video where the guy sings, ""It's getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot"" I realize that Pittsburgh's Whole Foods is not special - this is a common problem.  Small spaces, not enough parking, too many people driving through fighting for a spot, yeah, it's a mess.

It's almost always crazy busy in here.  I believe I'd come more often if the shopping experience was calmer.  But because of the insanity of the parking lot and the hectic shopping (people everywhere bumping into each other)  that takes place inside, I truly limit my shopping here.  To like once a year.

Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy. (Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). 

The produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is...

The HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar. My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. 

Some of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's ""chicken"" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. 

As a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B! In general the soups are hit or miss, but a real hit is the triple squash or Butternut squash, something like that. It's next to sushi. It's very good",0,wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ,0,4,2014-10-09,review,0

One thing about Whole Foods is they specialize in fresh fruits and vegetables.  Their produce is definitely impressive. All of the oranges, lettuce, berries and bananas peppers are perfectly ripe.  They never have spoiled or bad fruit.

In my opinion, it is a little overwhelming at first and here's why. Like most People in the US, I was brought up on all of the ""typical"" mainstream American food brands. So when I walked into this place and barely recognized any brands, it was slightly overwhelming. It took a little research and I still do some research on some products before making a trip. I recommend going online and checking their coupons before making a trip - I tried a bunch of new products that way. I have also googled ""best snacks at whole foods"" to get some more ideas of what to try. 

Now here's the sucky part- overall, whole foods is pretty overpriced. BUT I will say that it is not ENTIRELY their fault. They sell higher quality products than your average grocery store. Mostly all of their products are made with the best ingredients and are often organic and gmo free. They are vegan and vegetarian friendly and have tons of options for people with allergies. If companies are spending more money on better ingredients , they are going to have to sell their products for a higher price. 

Having said that, tazo tea for $4 a box is not a sale. I went a couple weeks ago and saw the sale price advertised, did a quick google search and realized target sells their tazo tea for $3.50 NOT on sale. Needless to say I took the trip down the street and saved myself some money for the tea. I also recently wanted to purchase kale chips that I heard so much about (brand is called brad's raw and the flavor was vampire killer)... Until I realized they were $9 for 2 oz ! You can get fresh kale for less than half the cost! 

Although whole foods can be expensive they aren't ALWAYS that bad. My favorite yogurt, wallaby organic yogurt, is sold here. On a normal day, it cost $1 each. A couple days ago, they were 89 cents each- not bad for organic yogurt. They also have an amazing selection of uniquely flavored chocolates and they are pretty reasonably priced. Justin's organic peanut butter cups are incredible! 

The customer service has  always been awesome in this particular location. I hear that whole foods is very willing to take back anything that you don't enjoy , as long as you have your receipt. 

as other yelpers have said- the parking sucks in this location, it's a nightmare. So keep that in mind before you visit.

Also if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section.

They also carry both local and national mix tapes and also have artist's coming through the store to show love.

1658,iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA,xkAfL-rpRyKGu_6-Drotuw,"Jimmy Tsang's Chinese Restaurant is one of the old ""traditional"" Pittsburgh restaurants, a place you remember as always ""being there.""  My parents feel the same way about it.  It is a good, if unspectacular place with reliable, tasty fare like honey chicken, Chinese flank steak, and authentic eggrolls.  

I don't normally go for the spicy fare, indeed I prefer the plainer dishes like chicken with vegetables, but they have one item on the menu that I've always wanted to try--Sau La Gi, which is stir-fried hot spicy chicken, onions, green onions & fresh bean sprouts.  Perhaps I've never noticed, but I don't recall seeing it anywhere else.  It was good, but Hoo-Boy did I have to pace myself while eating it.  And have plenty of water nearby!  Sau La Gi was worth trying once, but it really wasn't to my tastes and I doubt I'll have it again.

My friend Maryann tried  Ching Za Gai (spicy also) which is roasted crispy chicken served with tangy vinaigrette sauce.  I sampled it and perhaps I will order that for myself next time.  I'd like to cook a milder version of it myself at home.  

More to my tastes however are the Garden Chicken, Chicken with Broccoli, or Beef with Pea Pods.  Seafood dishes include Sweet and Sour Shrimp and  Sauteed Shrimp Szechaun Style.  Yeah, I'm a little unimaginative when it comes to Chinese food, but I know what I like and if a place can do the basics right, it's okay in my book!

Jimmy Tsang's also has a convenient and inexpensive lunch menu.  The place also does Korean Barbecue and you can book a private dining room for you and your special someone with a $100 deposit.",1,tvXTHj9V5sgRoeVJW_FiTg,0,3,2008-04-25,review,1

In other words, this place is *huge* inside.  The place looks like it was decorated about the same time many other cities built up chinatown areas; I like the decor, even if it might be slightly dated.

Hot & Sour soup was highly americanized, not very hot or very sour.
Wonton Soup was a very large portion and good.

Egg Rolls were large, slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless, not very good.
Cheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.
Chinese Flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch, a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.
Flaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas, bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.

Today I remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  The won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  The entree was fine.  

What really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  The smell wouldn't leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as I could) to get rid of the smell.  Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?

It merely has a chinese menu and a korean menu. The idea was cute. They even have typical chinese lunch specials.

The deco needs upgrading and dusting -- some lighting or even natural light (its like walking in a cave!) and some other reviews were right that it has a hint of smoke in the air. 

I had a craving for comfort food and ordered Jajangmyeon and grilled calamari. The tea and water was served as I sat down. I went a little after the lunch rush so there was not too many people. The calamari came out promptly and the Jajangmyeon took a little longer. The portions were huge! 

What took the longest and annoyed me the most (I was the only one left at the restaurant) was waiting for the check. Why does waiting for the check take 45 minutes?

As for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  I haven't really been disappointed yet!  The appetizers/small plates all pretty good, I really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends.  The entrees are always excellent - I usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  The desserts are ok, personally, I feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.  

Oh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!  And it is nice that you can order Veuve Cliquot by the glass ($16).

Prices are a bit high for what you'd expect for Pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, I would recommend it.

They have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  The smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  The truffled potato was yummy.  The arugula salad was as delicious as ever!

1673,TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ,oulyefOGLSaeYDwwWSuZZg,"Well it's official Shadyside is becoming my new favorite area for restaurants.  Damn you Big Burrito Group with your local ingredients, contemporary design and excellent service.  I was here last night and on a Monday this place was doing brisk business (definitely a good sign).  The space itself is beautiful.  You  enter from S. Highland into the outdoor dining area, which because of the heaters is viable almost every day of the year.  There is plenty of seating outdoors and a few tables indoors.  The design is contemporary.  The bar is large and has a nice area opposite for more informal seating.  The one thing I dislike about the bar area is that the ""stools"" are actually chairs that are not moveable, so your distance next to your ""neighbor"" is pre-determined.  I also prefer to stand at  the bar instead of sitting and this set up makes that more difficult.  The wine selection is pretty extensive and they have a good happy hour special that any wine or premium cocktail is just $5, which is really good when many of their wines are priced at over $10 per glass.  The hostess was very nice and professional even though she was young taking our names as we went to the bar for a drink and then anticipating our return with two menus in hand.  The server was a nice enough guy and helpful when it came time for our dinner selection.  We ordered a bottle of conundrum which is a delicious choice and I guess in line with what others charge.  We were started with an olive tepenade (sp?) and some crusty toasted thinly sliced ciabatta I think.  The tepenade was too oily and salty for me, but I guess it's what I should expect since it's ground up olives basically.  The bread was great.  It was warm really hearty bread that was wheat I think, definitely not white.  It was served with room temperature butter with some sea salt on top.  Really good start.  We then tried the smoked salmon appetizer.  I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and was pleased with the quality of the fish, served nicely with capers and chopped egg.  It also was served with a patatoe pancake that was crisp on the outside with warm and delicious  filling.  The only thing I was a bit perplexed about was why it wasn't served with some type of bread or crouton to put the salmon on.  However, the waiter was happy to oblige by bringing out a few of the toasted ciabatta.  We also tried the lamb mac and cheese (omg was this good).  The pasta was cooked al dente' and definitely made in house.  The sauce and lamb were amazing.  This would make a fine entree' in my opinion and is total comfort food reinvented.  The only detraction I'd say is that it is a very heavy dish to serve as an appetizer on a summer menu.  Fiona had the arugula salad which was nicely prepared with pork belly (kind of like bacon), feta, and a few other interesting ingredients.  We also tried the short rib ravioli, which was incredible as well albeit a heavy dish.  By the time we got to this I think we only tried one ravioli each (plenty of leftovers).  This is such a rich dish, because shortribs are like the epitome' of richness and then to wrap them in ravioli and add cream sauce is really indulgent.  But, then again this is my chef not my cardiologist.  I tried the Elysian Fields Lamb which was cooked perfectly medium and then served with their homemade pasta wrapped around some of the lamb as well.  This was really good and the pasta was a surprise.  I actually would have preferred a green vegatable on the side instead of pasta and mashed potatoes.

1685,q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ,mUruu951koaIXmKeAzWYlQ,"I have been coming to Casbah for over a decade (pretty much since it first opened).  I very much like the place, and it has maintained its general character even as the head chefs have changed over the years.  Casbah is very good about continually updating its menu in an effort to stay current and relevant.  Over the years I have enjoyed many wonderful meals here including a fantastic orrechete (sp?) pasta with chicken and cranberries in a lovely cream sauce, and some of the best pork  chops (double cut)  I have ever encountered (although I no longer eat mammals, so they are likely to be the best pork chops I will ever eat).  

This is not an inexpensive place, it can be quite pricey for dinner.  One plus is that they have a very reasonable brunch on Sundays.  Their arugula salad during brunch with small diced potatoes and pancetta is fantastic.  My one complaint about the salad is that it needs a bit of acid. I always ask for a small slice of orange and then squeeze the juice onto the salad.  This cuts through the fat from the pancetta and makes the salad even more tasty.

Others may disagree, but even though this is a fairly fancy place, it is suitable for children.  Casbah has a semi outdoor seating area that is enclosed and heated even in winter.  My wife and I have often dined here with our kids.  This semi outdoor area is a bit more casual and absorbs the sounds of loud children fairly well.  You can bring kids without suffering the disdain of any but the most obnoxious of fellow diners.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2009-01-22,review,0
1686,QE6vmJ3_MiBZD2o6uN1ZAQ,Vovij7SfgUyj-wRvjgS7Eg,"Amazing brunch! I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.

For $22, you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage, an appetizer and an entree. An incredible price for a serious amount of great food. They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large. 

I started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

I tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. 

Also, service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions. One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere.

For brunch in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite so far. Not to be missed!

I was surprised at how pricey it was before the coupons, but everything was good.

We started with two big glasses of sangria.  I thought the blueberry schnapps flavor was a little overpowering at first but it either evened out or I got used to it.

I had the risotto with morels, peas, and scallions, which was delicious.  I had never had morels before and now I understand why they're so pricey.  There was only a small handful of them on the side of the risotto, but they were delicious.  The risotto was very creamy and flavorful, the kind I wish I could make myself.  My best friend had the short rib ravioli, which she really enjoyed.  I tried the sauce and it wasn't nearly as rich as it looked.

We split a creme brulee for dessert, and the waitress very sweetly put candles in it and wrote Happy Birthday on the rim, which was a nice touch.  The creme brulee was good but definitely not the best I've ever had.  (That award may go to Soba's coffee creme brulee.)

The total bill would have been $72, which seems a bit steep.  But it was a nice restaurant and a really nice atmosphere.  The patio was lovely.  I will definitely be back, if not for brunch then absolutely for that delicious risotto!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2009-05-31,review,2

Gotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. 

What I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a ""Mediterranean"" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. 

I do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right?!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar!

Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.

While waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.

The smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.

My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.

Service was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2009-11-01,review,4

The waiter was less than helpful suggesting a wine to accompany our dinner, which I found to be a bit odd at such a nice restaurant.  My friend and I order split the tuna tartare and the fennel salad to start.  The tartare was decent but it lacked seasoning and I wasn't into the creme fraiche on top.  The salad was ok but nothing to rave about.  I had the short rib ravioli after reading the reviews on Yelp, but I didn't like the sauce that accompanied it.  My friend ordered the risotto with oyster mushrooms and she was also less than enthused.

And this is just not a one time bad experience, I have been here three times and have been less than enthused with the food vs price/value.

Service has always been good and attentive I enjoy their wines and the selections but on almost every dish there is something is either wrongly out of place or I expected much better for the money I am paying. For example:

Sumac scallop Appetizer, cooked perfectly, but the tartness of the sumac was not there, the other thing is I can brown a scallop at home, in a restaurant I am looking for a perfectly cooked scallop that has a nice caramelized sear on it, almost crunchy top juicy center. Also why so stingy with the baba ghanoush, 1 tsp, come on, eggplant is that expensive.

Risotto - Over cooked not even a little bit of toothiness to the grain, plus it was pretty devoid of flavor but seemed to have had the addition of cream and butter to make it creamy.

Duck Entrée, again duck was perfectly cooked, quince jus was nice, not overly sweet but the faro did not compliment the dish at all. I even had a dining companion taste the combination and asked if they like it and they said it didn't go.

Pasta entrée with spinach, this could have been good, but spinach was not washed and had grit in it, this item was returned and a braised lamb dish was ordered in its place, the lamb was slightly undercooked (read just a little tough) and jus that went with it was very watery.

If this was some little bistro where I was paying $20-25 for dinner (no drinks) I wouldn't be so picky but some of my meals have been north of $40 and for that amount of money I expect a little more attention to detail.",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,1,3,2009-12-28,review,1

My most recent trip was with my wife on 1/15/10. We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. For entrees, I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream / cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich). 

The grilled flat bread came with three different dips, Humus, Red Pepper Hummus, and Baba Ganoush. I really enjoyed all three, but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. The butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it. 

As far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. The sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. I can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful. 

I tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall I thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. Incredibly tender and flavorful. 

Neither of us were too impressed with our desserts. The creme brulee was very good, but at that point, I expected it to be great. My wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry. 

The bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it.

Revision: 

I was just back at Casbah for a fundraising dinner.  Once a month they do a private dinner for a charity - for $100 there is a five course meal with wine flights.  All proceeds (not just the profits) go to the charity.

My dinner was so good, I literally almost cried.  The wild mushroom risotto was bar far one of the the best things I've ever eaten in my life.  Short rib ravioli was my 3rd favorite thing I ate that evening, but I found myself dreaming of it the next morning!  I had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!) but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream.  The cornbread cake was an excellent balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and blue berries.  It was amazing!

While I don't believe these are regular menu items, I highlight this because this was their charity dinner.  That they made NO money off of.  An area where they could skim on quality - but no - it was amazing.  Reaffirmed my belief that this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2010-01-17,review,0

While the menu changes daily, there are several mainstays available on most evenings.  One of them, the pork chop, is one of the finest I have ever had.  Double cut, juicy and flavorful, it is an absolute winner.  Braised kale and butternut squash risotto accompany this perfect dish.

I managed to sample two other dishes (courtesy of my willing dinner mates) that are also noteworthy.  The short rib ravioli is an excellent combination of tender, richly flavored beef rib and toothy pasta.  The ricotta cavatelli combines fresh, simple ingredients into a well structured dish.

Service was a little hit or miss the evening I was there.  Part of that may be because we were a large group and the restaurant was rather busy.

I made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. Have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders? Probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don't expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. The food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. The bread was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, ""the host is supposed to do that but I will..."" Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. 

I was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. 

Casbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.

We were seated outside, in the covered, heated patio. We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same.
We started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. 
For entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day!
My boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too ""fishy"" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. 
Instead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level.

1704,5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA,7GAcFg4nSnf0OqeAXRxekw,"For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.

When our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.

Waiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.

Finished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be ""right out.""  While I guess she didn't define ""right out,"" what this actually meant was ""in 25 minutes.""  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory mélange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.

Vastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.

For my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb ""Mac and Cheese"", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.

Completing our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with ""just the bill.""

Settling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with ""I hope you will join us again."" I will not.",2,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,2,1,2010-07-06,review,2

I had a wine flight (they have a good wine selection), and several appetizers, soups and salad.  Everything was delicious, especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.  Most of the ingredients come from local farms and food suppliers, and I really liked they even gave them credit on the menu, the first time I have ever seen that in a restaurant (shouldn't they deserve at least as much credit as the chef? After all, they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).

The atmosphere is really cool, I recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.  The only negative things I can say about Casbah is the high price for relatively little food and the misleading name (I expected more of a Middle Eastern menu and vibe).",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2010-07-25,review,0

The sweet corn fondue appetizer was a definite highlight of the lunch.  I had thought that the cheese might drown out the flavor of the corn, but both flavors held their own very well.  The chanterelle mushroom and goat cheese omelet I had as my entree was okay but not outstanding.  I did, however, enjoy the mesclun salad that came with the omelet, especially the vinaigrette and fried shallot slices.  Dessert was a semolina cake with macerated fresh peaches and cream cheese ice cream (think cheesecake flavored).  The bookends of my meal were so delicious that I wasn't all that disappointed by the middle portion of it.

While I can't afford Casbah on a regular basis as a grad student, the prices aren't exorbitant.  There's even a lunch special for $14, which gives you two courses: either a salad or cup of soup, and your choice of a pasta, risotto, or half a sandwich.  I didn't choose this option, but it seems like a reasonably-priced way to sample several things on the menu.

Our server was very professional, and checked on us after every course (the appetizer, entrees and dessert).  I'll definitely keep Casbah in mind for special occasions in the future.  It's classy without being pretentious or stuffy.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2010-08-26,review,2

I got a free entree coupon for my birthday, for signing up for Big Burrito's mailing list, and decided to revisit Casbah.  The good: we got to enjoy the patio even though the weather was a little cool because it was heated.  My maccheretto, a pasta entree with white beans, sun-dried tomato, pesto and walnuts, was very good.  The pasta was al dente and the white beans were perfectly cooked (not mushy).  It was maybe a touch too salty (the fontina, maybe?), but I was happy with the choice.  

Now, onto the weird.  After taking our orders, our waiter asked if we wanted bread with our big-calorie pasta dishes.  Checking if we want bread is fine--but, umm, he could have left out the comment about the pasta?  My friend and I are both twentysomething women.  Luckily, we're not that insecure about our bodies.  We like to eat.  Yes, bring the bread.

When he brought our entrees, he sang ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you"" under his breath as he put my pasta in front of me.  I don't like people singing to me at restaurants, so I'm grateful it wasn't audible to everyone else on the patio--but a simple ""Happy birthday"" would have sufficed.  Then when he cleared our plates, he asked if my dish was ""everything [I] wanted, and more.""  I appreciate the gestures, but it felt artificial.

He asked if we'd like to see the dessert menu--and added that he was supposed to ask that, that we shouldn't feel obligated.  Uh, what?  I think this and the bread/pasta comment bothered me the most.  

To redeem the birthday coupon, you have to show an ID.  I recently cut my hair, so it's different than my license photo.  When he returned my ID to me, our waiter said, ""I like the short hair.""  If this had been the only unusual statement he had made during the meal, I would have taken it as a compliment.  I guess it is one.  But when considered with all the other weird things, it just felt like he was trying way too hard and my friend and I both felt awkward.

The food here is good and I feel that the service this time was unusual, and the more professional service I had on my first visit here is closer to the norm.  I'd feel leery, though, if I were to have this particular server again.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2010-09-10,review,2

The port flight was unique and the wine list was good.  The bartender has a little trouble with our cocktail orders, but those were good as well.  The covered patio was perfect for a Friday evening in late August--it was pouring outside and we stayed dry.  The service was so-so, which I'm docking a star for.  The server was attentive, but she was a little slow.  She also spilled the apple icewine on two of us while bringing out deserts and we were charged for those drinks.  It gets crowded, so make a reservation.

Their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  It was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.

I came back for dinner a month or so later.  We had reservations (on a Monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  We sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, Mediterranean garden.  And yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  Even with my young eyes, I still needed a candle to read the menu.  But it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  A little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  Sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.

The menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  I actually had a cocktail to start - the Perfect Pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  There was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  It was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors I love.  Still, for the price, I think the portion was a little stingy.  When I buy an $11 cocktail, I like it to really fill the glass.  We nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - I think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  It was a bit bland - I think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.

Things got better during the actual dinner.  I ordered the Heritage Farms Chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  Each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  It's just squash!  But somehow, it was heavenly.  My friend enjoyed her Cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  I tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  The only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  Actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  I tasted them too, and I have to say - it was off-putting.  Perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  Fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.

We also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  I didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  I enjoyed our creme brulee - because I enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.  

Overall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  I had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  But this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.  I think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2010-11-29,review,1

You can select a drink (alcoholic or non), an appetizer, and a brunch entree for the price of $22. The appetizers we had (pollenta and squash&chestnut soup) were very good. The entrees, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. We got the mushroom omelet and jumbo lump crab and tomato omelet. The omelet was very bland. It did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs. Basically, I have had better omelets at some Denny's. My drink mimosa was just OK. My girlfriend's blood mary was delicious, though -- uniquely spicy. 

I have been to Casbah 4 times, last time being for brunch today. The first time, it was good, worthy of 4 stars. It gradually went down to 3 stars. The wine selection is good.

However, we decided to give it another chance, and I am glad that we did. 

Even though we had a reservation, we were seated (without them asking us our preference) in the front area, but that was fine, since the heaters kept it toasty warm. It was also a great table thanks to our terrific waitress. Wow, was she cheerful and friendly! She was also helpful with making recommendations - when I asked her about the cocktails, she pointed out the relatively new ""Beet and Potato,"" which had beet-infused vodka as one of the main ingredients. It was a cool cocktail - an interesting blend of savory and sweet, and very seasonally appropriate. I don't know if I would order it again, but I'm very glad I had it once.

For dinner, I ended up having a soup and then an appetizer, since I wasn't too hungry. The caramelized onion soup was so warming - it was like an update of the classic french onion soup. The broth was not too salty (a common problem with onion soups), and the onions had been braised perfectly. Everything was just the right texture as the onions, broth, and ""crouton"" blended together.

I ordered the sheep's milk gnudi for my main course. Even though it came in an appetizer-sized portion, it was still a lot of food, since the gnudi are so filling. The gnudi were nicely molten in the middle, and just the right softness on the outside. There were a variety of accompaniments to the gnudi, but the standouts were the brussel sprouts. I'm actually not a huge fan of sprouts, but I ate every one in the dish. They were light and buttery, solid but not rock-hard, and had just a trace amount of bitterness left. That is how sprouts should taste!

Even though I didn't plan on ordering dessert, I ended up getting the warm walnut baklava with cinnamon ice cream. The warmth of the baklava melted the ice cream nicely, and the flavors just blended together on the plate. The baklava was quite traditional in its assembly and spice blend, but the extra cinnamon with cream gave the whole dessert just a bit of extra oomph.

In summary, I'm glad that we gave Casbah another try. I wish that they would go back to offering all of their pastas in both entree and appetizer sizes, and I miss the crazy variety of wine flights that they used to have (it seems like they just have 4 now), but it's still a great dinner destination.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2011-02-04,review,2

I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. I ended up boxing half of my omlette entree. Portions were large, atmosphere was cool, food was good and wait staff were awesome but in the end I don't think $24 (not including the tip and tax) was worth it.",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,3,2011-09-04,review,4

I don't know how a place owned by a company called Big Burrito Group churns out such outstanding Mediterranean fare, but I was impressed.  Everything was done right--the ambiance was sophisticated yet unpretentious, service was professional, and the wine list was impressive, especially the by-the-glass options, which were necessary since I was dining solo.  The food (I started with grilled Spanish octopus and then had the halibut) was all fresh and prepared to perfection, with inventive flavoring that complimented rather than overwhelmed the dishes themselves.

The restaurant is really cool looking but I was a little confused by the bar set up.  We sat at the bar because they didn't have any tables open.  I usually don't mind sitting at the bar but the stools are bolted to the floor, and about 2 feet from each other.  If you have three people with you, forget about mingling!  

Also, the service was very iffy.  There was a bartender, and then a server for the bar area (or what it seemed like).  The bartender got us our drinks, but never told us a server would be with us.  I figured she was our server too.  But then some other woman came up to us all flustered.  She never introduced herself, just asked what we wanted and kept saying ""okay, okay, okay.""  Just very odd.  It continued that way the entire time.

I tried the prix fixed brunch for $24, which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie (Bloody Mary, Sangria or Mimosa), appetizer and main course.  I had the mimosa, that was the perfect mix (splash of OJ:), Polenta and Eggs Beni.  The cinnamon polenta, which was delish: light, fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top.  I loved it!

The Eggs Beni with smoked salmon.  It was just okay.  I kept trying to think pf what was missing and I believe it was that the hollandaise sauce had no real taste.  I expect hollandaise sauce to be rich and creamy, this was thin and blah.  

I definitely want to go back and try the dinner, see if maybe I'll have a little better luck.  So kick it up a notch Casbah, you've been around for a while, but I still expect good food!",2,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,2,3,2011-11-13,review,8

I ordered the Piccola Gusto Menu which for me included the Cream of Cauliflower soup, the Orecchiette Pasta and the Roasted Turkey Sandwich.  It sounds like a lot of food but the pasta serving is mini and it's a half sandwich.  For me, the size was just right.  The soup was awesome, and I could have eaten an entire lunch of just it.  The pasta was a little too creamy for me and just didn't have enough seasoning or spice.  I did love the addition of the cranberries in it though.  The perfect amount of sweet to offset the cream.  The roast turkey sandwich was just that.  Not out of this world, but not bad.  My biggest complaint was the service.

It had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no?  Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba.  In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab.  No overkill on the sauce.  The soup was likewise good.  I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality.  I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price!

1737,-Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw,WI3cp0Sar1xAynonV1w-Xw,"This review is for brunch only! I've never been here for dinner...but been here quite a few times for brunch.

Casbah's brunch is a prix fixe...which at first seems expensive, but when you realize the amount of food you're getting, it's sooo not. You get an appetizer, entree, and drink (yes, a real drink, with alcohol) for just $24. I usually end up spending more at my other Big Burrito brunch spot, Kaya, so I consider this a pretty good deal.

They start you off with a basket of muffins and biscuits with honey butter on the side. And it's refillable. Try to restrain yourself from eating too many baked goods though, so you can get to the real food. For appetizers, everything I've had was pretty good (polenta and the salads have been my faves), but for the entree, there is only ONE thing you should order: The lamb & eggs!  Crusty sourdough bread topped with spinach topped with braised lamb shoulder and roasted garlic, topped with poached eggs. One of the best things I have ever eaten in the morning. The scallop scramble is just okay, the steak & eggs are pretty delish...but the lamb & eggs is by far the best thing on the brunch menu.

This is one of the few places where I don't opt for the Bloody Mary...it's pretty blah. I do their Salty Dog with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, or sometimes get it sans alcohol if I'm really feeling the pain from Saturday night.

Unfortunately, while I love the atmosphere, I feel like the service is lacking. I can't explain why, but it always feels awkward and doesn't hold up to the standards set at other Big Burrito spots (even Mad Mex). I know it gets busy on Sundays, but still.

Casbah prints their menu daily so some of their dishes you see online won't be offered that day. You'll still find something delicious, though.

We thought the place looked kind of shoddy when we saw the front of it, but it turns out they pitch up a tent-house in front of the actual restaurant to make their usual outdoor seating into additional seating during the wretched Pittsburgh winter.

Our bread came with a walnut pecorino pesto and it was AMAZING. We were kind of disappointed that they only gave us 4 slices but the food we had ordered came out so quickly afterwards that we barely had time to mope about it.

I ordered the long island duck, with chestnut spaetzle, brussels sprouts, sage, 
apples, and cherries. The tanginess of the cherry and mild fruitiness of the apple was an amazing complement with the rich meatiness of the duck jus. I didn't think there was enough sauce but both the duck breast and duck leg were so tender I didn't care. I ended up almost finishing the entire plate even though the serving size was considerably large. All of that for under $30. 

My boyfriend got the lamb shank, which was a super simple dish (lamb with mashed potatoes) that they managed to make out of this world. Super tender with a generous amount of lamb jus swimming around the plate. 

For dessert, please get the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It takes a while for it to come out because they bake it on the spot. The 10 minute wait is so worth it. There are huge chunks of super dark chocolate and fresh raspberries in the fluffiest bread pudding I've ever had. Just remember not to burn yourself on the plate like I did.

Boy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. 

We shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. 

Many yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about.

I ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta.

When he sent it back, no apology...and no change in the bill.  I at least expected a manager or someone to come out and apologize and say ""We've taken it off the bill"" or SOMETHING.  Nope.  He sat there watching the rest of us finish our entrees before his replacement steak arrived.

Food: 
- Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal!
- Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking
- Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory and I would definitely order it again
- Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.
- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  
caramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.

I knew the building from the early 80's when it had been one of Pittsburgh's dive gay bars called 'The Tender Trap', and knowing this, as well as a lot about the Big Bistroid Group...oops...Big BURRITO Group, I was curious to try it out and see if it lived up to the usual Big Burrito hype.  And voila, indeed, it's another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burgh.

The atmosphere is actually quite lovely, inside or out. The colors are comfortable, the noise levels subtle, the seating comfortable, and the service staff looks professional (YOUNG) with no Coney Island side show appearances.

The service was good. Not overly friendly, but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bugh.

The menu was short, but did have a list of pretty unique offerings.  My friend had a salmon salad, and I opted to try the Farm Lamb Mac-n-Cheese.  The waiter brought a small basket with bread to the table accompanied by a single medium sized pat of salted butter to spread.  For a beverage, we both opted for just water.

I have to say, if I actually had to pay for this, I would have been pretty miffed.  

For LUNCH, the prices were all around the $15 range, and the portions were NOT large.  The portions were actually fine for lunch, not overly filling (by any stretch of the imagination), but they didn't leave you hungry.

I can't speak for the salmon, as I have NEVER had salmon in any form other than lox that didn't taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish. She seemed to enjoy it very much, so there it is.

The Farm Lamb mac n cheese was tasty. The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.  It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.

Basically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.

Seriously? $15 for lunch? It's mac n cheese people!

I also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah? Farm Lamb mac n cheese? Sure, I can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desert...not.

I can't say the experience was awful. The company was awesome, and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was tasty.  But was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation?  I honestly can't say 'yes' with any kind of cheerleader rave.  

I'm not quite sure that I comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it, when honestly, food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion.

During my latest experience, I was impressed by the hearty fall entrees. I decided to take my husband to Casbah for his birthday on friday night. I called on Monday and luckily, I was able get a reservation without a problem. When we arrived, the restaurant was packed but we did not have to wait. We were sat in the beautiful front covered patio area. 

We decided to start our meal with the veal and pork meatballs. This was my favorite part of the meal. I could have ordered 3 of these for my entree! The polenta and the crispy brussel sprouts added a smoothness and a salty crunch. Delish. You have to try these! For my entree, I ordered the double cut pork chop and my husband ordered the cioppino. The huge pork chop arrived medium well, as requested, but was still tender and juicy, even better when dipped in the sage jus. In additiion, the bitterness of the braised kale paired well with the smooth, creamy parmesan and proscutto risotto. My husband was also a big fan of the cioppino. The mussels, clams, shrimp, halibut and scallops were cooked to perfection. I was equally impressed with the size of the scallops. We're talking the width of a coffee cup!

When we got there, they took a minute to figure out where we would sit even though it appeared that they were empty. However,  1/2 way through dinner it seemed like they were seating those with reservations inside and walk ins outside. 

The place is set up with what would be the patio, enclosed. There are big heaters on the ceilings that are directed straight at the tables. I will say that it was a little too warm and even though the host said he would turn them down, I don't think that was done. 

The waitress came and told us about the menu, took our drink orders and brought us some bread with a yogurt spread and salted butter. I did ask her if the $10 off entrée coupon could be used on the pasta entrées and I think at that point she began to think that we were poor young kids. But back to that later. . . 

To start we shared the crispy calamari ($11) with capers, lemons, chili and parsley which was probably some of the best calamari ever. It was not chewy and it had the best sauce ever! We also ordered the grilled chickpea flatbread appetizer ($9) which I expected to be a flatbread but actually came as grilled pita with three separate dips - baba ghanoush, hummus and red pepper muhummara. 

For dinner, I ordered the short rib ravioli ($24) which came with swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots and gremolata. This was the more decadent dish ever! When it first came, it had about 6 raviolis and didn't appear to be enough but it was more than enough!

My husband ordered the Casbah Double Cut Pork Chop ($27) which came with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream and a sage jus. The pork was very moist and the risotto was cooked perfectly. There were no left overs!

After this huge meal, we decided on taking a dessert to go. We both agreed upon the Dark Chocolate Rasberry Bread Pudding ($8). So I asked the waitress if it would travel well since we wanted to take it to go. At that time, she looked at me and asked if we had a toaster oven where we lived. . . Um yes lady we do, in fact we have an oven also AND we own our own home. Despite the comment, we took the dessert home and put it in the oven later that night and we were not disappointed. 

Overall the meal was delicious, we got to use two $10 off coupons and I would highly recommend it to anyone. However, I still favor Eleven!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2012-11-18,review,0

For appetizer, I got the granola and berries and my friend got the creamy polenta. Both were great options!

My main course was Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin with flageolet beans, merguez sausage, turnips, greens and whole grain mustard. It was cooked perfectly pink, as ordered, and the flavors complemented each other.

I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a ""yes, it's got lemon in it."" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, ""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink."" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks.

Bit of a complex review.  My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.

We sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.

1765,Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw,WQZLbjXNp2IdJdx_qaf9ig,"When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.

The hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  

Service was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.

We ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!

The second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.

Lake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!

Finally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.

Our experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2013-01-06,review,1

The Piccolo Forno allows for a choice of Salad or soup, a pasta or risotto, half sandwich. I went with a taste of the Pea Tendrils and Frisee Salad, while slightly complex to eat, it had a savory flavor from the light dressing and blue cheese crumbles, then I went with cauliflower risotto which was riculous. That is how you make risotto people. For the half samich I went with the half turkey. The turkey wasn't just a normal turkey slice from the deli counter this was actually very nicely trimmed meat off of a bird that was prepared in house and it was immediately noticeable.

The set-up is...different? I couldn't quite figure out what was going on with it; you basically walk into a door and enter what looks like what was once a courtyard, which was covered with a canvas - maybe they take this down during the summer? Possibly? I'm not sure; anyway, if you walk to the back of the courtyard you'll get into the actual bar.

The menu here, at least during my visit, was delicious - fantastic fresh sangria, a very interesting but tasty bruschetta (that, rather than going with the traditional tomatoes and basil, was covered in a kind of cream cheese, greens and nuts), and a reasonably portioned bowl of pasta with sausage and spinach. Not complaints, other than the fact that the pasta was a bit spicy and I wasn't warned about this. It wasn't too strong, though.

Our waitress was doing the best that she could (I think) but was a little slow. Still, the place was fairly busy and I had good company to talk to during my meal, so no hard feelings on that one.

When we went for brunch it was quite crowded and we had to wait a while before getting seats at the bar. The food is really fantastic though and there are good vegetarian options.

It had been a couple of years since I had last been to Casbah and while I remembered it being decent, it differed a bit from my fiance's opinion that this was the best of the Big Burrito restaurants.  Due to that it had been on my list of restaurants to visit so that I could get a better opinion of it.  The restaurant looked the same that I remembered it with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller one inside with the bar on one side of the restaurant and the dining room on the other.  It was all nicely and tastefully decorated.

I arrived shortly after 5 PM and immediately made my way into the bar area of the restaurant as I hate taking up a table if I am eating by myself.  There was no one else at the bar at this point and the bartender quickly greeted me and gave me a happy hour menu while explaining it to me.  I had not been planning on getting a drink but one of the $6 cocktails caught my eye and I ended up ordering it.  The bartender was pretty friendly guy and explained how he came up with the drink while he made the drink and we chatted for a bit.  For my entrée I decided to order the Long Island Duck which was a roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, rosemary, black mission figs and duck jus.  Whenever I had ordered it I had actually missed the fact that it came with a braised leg and was excited to see that extra unexpected portion of meat on my plate whenever it was delivered to me.  The whole meal ended up being incredibly tasty with the duck breast being cooked perfectly with nice seasoning and not greasy at all.  This was in stark contrast to the leg which was incredibly juicy and greasy which I absolutely loved.  Normally I am not a fan of greasier duck but the two preparations really helped to enhance the other.  Finally the figs provided a nice touch of sweetness while the gnocchi was pillow like and tasty.  It was also nice to be able to taste a hint of rosemary on them which I had forgotten about between the time I had ordered and when it was delivered.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  Both my cocktail and my meal were really good and I would actually consider this to be one of the best meals that I have eaten in a little while.",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2013-06-27,review,1

The calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great start to the meal and not too heavy or filling and I could eat a whole basket of the warm bread. I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there, but maybe they do! 

The pork chop is their signature dish and does not disappoint. My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy on the inside and had a great crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE, delicious scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very impressive. I was there with a group of 6 this time and everyone had clean plates at the end of the meal.

We started with a cheese trio with was paired well with different preserves and chutneys.  We then had roasted octopus and the scallops.   The scallops for me were very interesting and a little too sweet for my taste with the pear and lacked texural components.  However the octopus has a real nice char, and was full of great well rounded flavors.  For our entrees, my bf got the duck which was underseasoned, and the fat was jot rendered out correctly.  The skin was also burnt.  The sides and vegetbales of the dish were seasoned and cooked beautifully though.  I had the lamb loin and it was perfectlh medium rare with delicious bitter greens.

I also love the cheese selections here. I usually ask my waiter to surprise me with any combination, and it's always fantastic. I am a sucker for the duck here. It's duck two ways-roasted breast and braised legs. Absolutely delicious. The gnocchi on the side is fantastic. I also like the double cut pork chop with the braised kale, as well as the roasted chicken because the polenta on the side is so yummy.

The wine list is pretty good, and the waiters are generally knowledgable about pairings, which is nice, because sometimes you just want to sit back, relax, and let someone else do the work.

You can't go wrong with any of the pastas. It's sometimes fun to split a pasta as a starter. It's a nice way to try a variety of dishes. The orrechiette is a great choice because it combines the tartness of cranberries with the savory creaminess of goat cheese. Yum!

I started with a homemade chicken noodle soup. Didn't expect to see it on the menu here, but it was really good. My party got the tuna tartare, and 2 different olive dishes. Seeing the prices on the menu (all $22+ for entrees) I would have expected a $5 plate of olives to be about 5-6 olives. But it was a bowl full. And they were yummy. For entrees we had the duck breast, which according to my boyfriend is the best and most perfectly cooked duck he's ever had. I had a prosciutto plate, it was technically an app, but it's my birthday and I'll eat what I want! Another member had the cioppino, and she loved it.

I remember being underwhelmed by the food, but that could've been the chilly reception with which I was met during this particular dinner and the conversation that entailed. 

Fast forward fifteen years later (what?!) and I was back at Casbah with Jonathan D. and my future in-laws.  We enjoyed the prix-fixe brunch, and enjoy it we did!  The meal started with a small basket of mini goodies including double chocolate muffins, cranberry almond scones and buttermilk biscuits.  The meal included choice of breakfast cocktail, appetizer and entree. For my selections I chose a bloody mary, Smoked Salmon and Sea Scallop Fry.  Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time?  I dare.  The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely sublime for smoked salmon.  The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over.  My main entree consisted of two plump and juicy sea scallops on a bed of sweet potatoes, carmelized onions and sausage (I substituted chicken sausage for the included fennel sausage).  In addition, the entree included a portion of melt-in-your-mouth white corn grits and scrambled eggs that seemed out of place and that I completely could've done without.  A croissant was also included but I asked for fruit instead and was rewarded with a small side of grapes, canteloupe and strawberries.  My fellow brunchers feasted on a variety of Creamy Polenta (looked amazing), a cheese tasting, Lamb and Eggs, and Casbah Benedict. Everyone left smiling and satisfied.

Service was mostly attentive, and very friendly throughout the evening. The wine list is varied and reasonably prices, with especially fine after dinner selections. 
We started with two appetizers this time out, the Tuna Tartare and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi. The tuna was very clean, served with nicely grilled sourdough. The Gnudi had a great truffle butter and tarragon flavored sauce. 
I also had my all-time favorite salad, the Arugula. This masterpiece features homemade pancetta, crimini mushrooms, and goat cheese. We split the Ricotta Cavatelli Pasta, prepared thoughtfully with fennel sausage and spinach. 
Dessert was a nice assortment of house prepared sorbets (mixed berry/pineapple/grapefruit).

Liked eating ""under the outdoor extension"" under the well working heaters- it is fun and really makes it feel like a more unique dining experience.  OK now on to the food. We started with a Spanish grilled octopus - it was delicious - charred grilled taste, delightful blood orange accompaniment - perfect.  Then had we not had the Habitat beet salad yesterday (it was amazing - check my review) - this would be the best, B U T it was still very good and had Maytag blue cheese, pistachios and nice beets - OK not amazing, but nice beets. Then we had another unfortunate comparison to Habitat.  When we had the pork chop - generous portion but a bit fatty. (Again Habitat's was so much better)  We also had the new pasta dish on the menu which was ok - big scallops (4) but a less than impressive sauce.  Glad we went here - it was different, but not really special and the nightmare of getting a taxi back was just -- well a nightmare (what is wrong with Pittsburgh taxi service -- everything)  City fathers (and Mothers) -- fix this!!!!!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2014-04-05,review,0

Yes, our dinner group quickly racked up a big bill - but it was for a birthday party, and Casbah had kindly sent along a $30 off dinner coupon beforehand. Even better, they went ahead and applied the discount even though we managed to forget to bring the actual card they had sent ahead to us. We had been completely prepared when asking about this to potentially not be able to use that $30 off at our visit, so their understanding alone would have gone a long way in making the meal a good one.

The amazing food just sealed the deal. Between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of Casbah's current menu - including their scallops, arugula salad, duck, pork and veal meatballs, and a ricotta very similar to what I had ordered the last time I visited. Everything was stupendously delicious - I honestly have no other words for how good this food was - and we all left full and satisfied with no complaints.

Casbah has definitely become a restaurant that I can come to for special events. Their food and service impressed me again tonight even more than they did last time; add in the fact that they use local ingredients whenever possible and always have something new to try with the changing seasons, and I'm completely sold.

1825,uDIecT9tlTj1XIeqoyZUyg,pKcQEu1QMRLWRuBBLqFU3A,"Big Burrito does it again! Casbah is located on a wonderful, neighborhood street in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh. We got there a little early and waited a little in the lot. Our reservation was for 11 and they open at 11. We were still told the valet had to move our car. I get they have a way they do things and it must work for them but the lot has about 40 spaces that you can see from the street so I don't know why valet is necessary. We are particular about our vehicles and we don't valet anywhere. Not that the valets weren't nice and it's not like we could not see them move the car but anyway...the main reason they get a 4 and not a 5 star. Onto the meal...

We waited just a few minutes in line to be seated. As I said our reservation was at 11 & that is when they open. We were seated promptly requesting the inside area of their dining room. They do have a very nice, shaded patio area as well complete with ceiling fans. We requested to sit inside and the hostess happily obliged. We were greeted quickly by a happy and knowledgeable waitress who was on it. She was not at all intrusive but our water was never empty and we didn't have to wait long for our check when we were done. She asked if we wanted any other beverage. I got an iced tea and the hubby requested iced coffee. The waitress noted they could make one for him by adding ice to coffee and he said yes. He was very happy they would accommodate his request. 

We ordered our food and were promptly brought a basket of bread (oh the wonderful bread basket!). We got 3 types of amazing breadly goodness that included cranberry scones (wow), biscuits (warm, soft, & the Hubby's favorite), and (my favorite) the lime, coconut muffin (sweet, lime, coconut, what's not to love). Oh, and let us not forget the maple butter, yum! I ordered the smoked salmon app. The combo of salmon, capers, aioli, and truffled potato cake - absolute perfection! There was a salty, smokey, sweet flavor that was sheer joy on my taste buds. The hubby chose the creamy polenta which he thoroughly enjoyed noting it was very oatmeal like. For my entree it was the sea scallop fry minus the caramelized onions. I would SOOOO get this again! The scallops were cooked to perfection with a wonderful golden outside that makes my heart sing with joy (can you tell I love a good sea scallop?). The combo of English peas, fennel sausage, and white corn grits...it was something special for sure! I could eat that sausage by the boat load every single day! And the grits - smooth, creamy, and perfectly seasoned. Not that it needed it but the dish comes with scrambled eggs and a beautifully, buttery croissant. My brunch was so satisfying, Heaven! The hubby chose the eggs Benedict with prosciutto. He liked it but noted he should have gotten the spinach not the prosciutto. He said the prosciutto seemed vinagary. The dish includes paprika roasted fingerling potatoes which were mild and perfectly cooked. And for dessert we chose the chocolate stout cake on a wine caramel drizzle served with a little dish of creme brulee ice cream. Holy cow! What a terrific chocolate cake & the ice cream rocked too. 

Overall, I would recommend Casbah to everyone noting their brunch was fabulous! The valet (even though the need for valet is questionable) and wait staff were super nice, attentive, & knowledgeable.

Great place to take visitors or for special occasions.

I'm a huge seafood person so the first time I ordered a Bloody Mary with the smoked salmon to start and sea scallop fry as my main.  I'm a fan of their Bloody, it's spicy and flavorful. The smoked salmon was filling enough that it's easy to split and the truffled potato cake served with it melts in your mouth. The sea scallop fry is everything you would expect, almost too much food, but no complaints.

My second trip to Casbah brunch, I went with my old favorite of the smoked salmon but split it with my friend who ordered the cheese plate. Also, I ordered the Braised Lamb & Eggs as my main based on friends' recommendations. It's honestly to die for. Rich and flavorful in the best way, attributed to the tarragon sauce and the slow roasted lamb, and easily their specialty. If you want to order something you can't get anywhere else, order this. It's very filling and rich, especially if you get a filling first course.

It can be a little more cramped on the inside, but it's never too loud. If you can sit outside, it feels nice and spacious. It's also very nice downstairs.

The valet parking is a huge plus in my book, especially in that area of Shadyside. The service is always prompt and never overbearing. 

The last time we went, we had the sheep's milk gnudi and I'm pretty sure it was sent straight from heaven down on to our plate. I nearly fought my fiance for the last piece.

The cheese plate was wonderful, it came with 3 different spreads and 5 different cheese, and some prosciutto.  A+!
They gave us extra bread and the salted butter and their yogurt butter.  It was amazing and we gobbled it all up.
We all ordered the Arugala salad -- it was gorgeous. 
(Arugula, house-made pancetta, crimini mushrooms, potatoes, Riverview Farms goat cheese, pancetta vinaigrette )
I ordered the Roasted Gerber Farms Chicken (whole grain mustard grits,greens, fresno peppers, fava & preserved lemon pesto, thyme jus), my sister got the Ricotta Cavatelli,
(house-made fennel sausage, spinach,crushed tomatoes, ricotta), her fiance ordered the Grilled Swordfish(Swiss chard, roasted tomato, garlic, chilies, caper, crispy polenta, espelette, Meyer lemon vinaigrette), my boyfriend got the Long Island Duck (roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, rhubarb, duck jus)  \

My chicken was good, not great and a little flavorless. the mustard grits were superb, the lemon pesto kind of tasted like lemon pledge and really over powered the whole dish, which was really disappointing.
My sister ADORES their cavatelli, but this time... it came out cold. She is not one to complain and ate it regardless.
Her fiance's swordfish was perfectly prepared and tasted wonderful. 
My boyfriends duck was cooked to perfection and all the sides were incredible (so he says). 
When desert rolled around I was not interested as I was already so full from the dinner. 
My sister ordered a glass off prosecco and Chocolate S'more Cake
(toasted marshmallow, salted caramel ice cream,graham crumb) which was deadly! I tried a small bite but since I am not a sweets person it was overpoweringly chocolatey. Her fiance got the Vanilla Bean Crème Brulée

1837,RPJGvMZnlsQpk0l_QOK_FA,cFSpRCWAR3Iy3DdUH6MMtA,"Casbah has made my Top 10 Favorite Restaurants in Pittsburgh list. My friends and I went here for one of my friend's birthday. The food was simple yet delicious and transported me back to Greece. Upon being seated, they offered complimentary bread with butter and mascarpone spread. The waiter was very knowledge about the menu and recommended his favorites which included the pork chop entree and that soft shell crabs and corn were in season. As a result, my friends and I shared the soft shell crab app. The soft shell crab was fried to perfection with a small side salad of sliced asparagus and basil with tapenade. The only complaint I had with this dish was that there was only one to share between the three of us. 

For the entrees, I decided to heed the waiter's advice and selected the pork chop while my friends ordered the gnocchi and cioppino. What I am about to describe for the pork chop does not do it justice. The pork chop was cooked to the right temperature and did not lost its juiciness unlike most of my experiences with pork chop. It was also huge because it was double cut. The riscotto and braised kale complimented the pork chop well with the braised kale giving the pork chop an herbal component. I did not think I would be able to finish the dish but when I looked down again, everything was gone. I had the opportunity to try my friends' dishes and they were also prepared in an exceptional way. The veal and lobster in the gnocchi added a welcoming heartiness to the dish and the sauce reminded me of a curry. The unexpected combination of the gnocchi and curry-like sauce pleasantly surprised me. Since I have never tried cioppino until that day, I did not have anything to compare it but I was satisfied with the amount of seafood they gave. The only complaint from my friend was that the grilled bread that came with the dish was too hard for her to use to soak about the sauce. She used the complimentary bread instead and loved the sauce.

While we were ordering our dishes, we mentioned to our waiter that it was my friend's birthday. He brought out a dish of caramel with ""Happy Birthday"" written on it with dark chocolate sauce for her even though we didn't expect anything from them. I am grateful that they brought that dish out. I do not know if the caramel is on their menu but it melted right away in your mouth. 

If you managed to read all the way to the end of this review, you probably are asking why I didn't give Casbah all five stars and I will tell you the reason. Although our waiter went above and beyond to get my friend a birthday ""plate"", the service overall was not satisfactory. Throughout the meal, he did not come over to our table and took a long time getting our checks to us even though we blatantly had finished our dinner for awhile. I have gone to less delicious restaurants who offer better service.

Overall, the food at Casbah is exceptional. They change their menu based on what is in season. Here's a tip: if you sign up for the Big Burrito emails (the parent company of Casbah at https://secure.bigburrito.com/Register.aspx), you will get a free meal voucher on your birthday which is good at any of their restaurants.

I always salt food before even tasting it.  Nothing is off limits when it comes to me and my salt shaker.

Well when my beautiful meal arrived I asked my server for the salt.  None of the tables had salt or pepper shakers on them.  As my server went to get me the salt shaker, I took a bite of my potatoes.  Whoa!!!!!  They were extremely salty!!!!   For the first time in my life,  I didn't add any additional salt to my meal.  For me to say something is ""very"" salty.... It is very salty. 

Being the salt queen,  I stll  was able to enjoy and love my meal.  I am almost guarantee that the average person would not have enjoyed this food..  My friend also tasted my meal and immediately noticed the heavy taste of salt.  However he never salts anything so something with one grain of salt on it, he will be about to tell.  

It really suprised me that such an upscaled restaurant would have this much salt added to their food.  I am sure that it was an error or something.  I have eaten here in the past and never experience so much salt.

For the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.

The cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta.

Outside seating connected to an indoor area. Dim mood lighting. Relaxed but a notch above casual. 

FOOD:
Entree: Cioppino. 
Translation: Mixed seafood platter atop a savory broth. 

Imagine a shallow bowl containing a generous amount of shrimp, littleneck clams, mussels, striped bass, scallop arranged on top of a savory broth/sauce. A light soup-like consistency, the sauce rests at the bottom of the bowl. The entree comes with two triangle pieces of charred sourdough bread for more broth-dipping action. 

My favorite part of the Cioppino were the scallops and mussels and clams. Those items themselves were delicious, and even more tasty when accompanied with the broth. The bass and shrimp were prepared well, just not as flavorful. Although a generous portion, I would say this is a perfectly sized meal; not a heavy entree at all which to me is a good thing. 

SERVICE:
Our waiter was very knowledgeable and was confident with his recommendations. He didn't pull one of those ""well they're all pretty good, depends on what you like"" lines. Instead he rattled off the top items in each section and even emphasized a few that he highly recommended ""if this is the only time we are ever dining here"". We appreciated his honesty. Waters were kept filled, and he checked up on us regularly, but not overwhelmingly so like a helicopter parent. Ended the night with complementary salted caramels with our checks. A nice touch.

IMPRESSIONS: 
A solid dining experience, but I'm not sure if there was anything that left a special lasting impression. My group of grad student friends (we're the farthest thing from snobs) all agreed we enjoyed the food, but were not blown away. We all ordered different entrees that came highly recommended, which allowed us to sample the popular entrees. With the price point, I think we were hoping for a bit more. Definitely want to come back to try the brunch that people have raved about. I'm all about second chances.",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,3,2014-10-12,review,0

1847,AAzzf91szCG9FOu7DH9oYA,gbVK_8JHamWjbMLLMDf54w,"This update is for Casbah's brunch.

Alright, Casbah. You got me, you got me good. Dinner as I mentioned before was decent, but the brunch, amazing. Compared to dinner, brunch at Casbah is definitely the better meal and deal. I don't advocate playing favorites when it comes to siblings in the same family, but sometimes you can't help it. Brother Brunch gets the nod here.

Brunch is basically a fixed set. For $28, you choose an adult beverage (or non-alcoholic), an appetizer, and an entree. They start you off with some pistachio scones, buttermilk biscuits, and cornbread. Perfect, I like to stretch before I get my grub on. For my Prix-Fixe (fixed set), I went with the mimosa, smoked salmon, and sea scallop fry. 

SMOKED SALMON: If you like smoked salmon, then you would enjoy this appetizer. It's what you would expect but also a larger size than I thought it would be! ""Oh no, there's too much of something I like,"" said nobody ever. Upon seeing the smoked salmon display fanned out on its plate with bits of egg, red onion, and aioli garnished over top, my salivary glands couldn't control themselves! 

SEA SCALLOP FRY: You know I love me some scallops. The dish came with two scallops, a small croissant, small bits of fennel sausage, a side of white corn grits, and a little bit of butternut squash and caramelized onions. I was tempted to go with the classic eggs/toast/waffle as an entree, but I am so glad I put on my big boy foodie stretchy pants and took a chance. It's not your typical brunch dish and it's one I would definitely recommend. 

All in all, fantastic brunch experience. Definitely felt comfortably full, but not in a self-hatred, ""I-regret-this-decision-immediately"" kind of way. Service was professional; our waitress kept the waters filled and came in to check on us a little after each dish was served.",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,5,2014-11-16,review,1

I think for brunch they offer one of the best bloody Mary's in the city, with just the right amount of kick! My favorite dinner entree was the casericcia - not sure if I spelled it correctly. Why did they ever remove it from the menu is anyone's guess. It was amazing. I went there for my birthday dinner and was ready to order it when the waiter explained that they removed it from the menu despite it being one of their most popular dishes. What a total let down. Nothing compares to it in my book. That's the only reason I'm giving Casbah a 4 star review...

When my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. 

First off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.

in my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. 

I'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. 

For me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!",1,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,1,2,2014-11-30,review,1

Also, the desserts are mandatory!  

The duck confit gnocchi is smashing-- it's a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savory--and my favorite is probably the Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop: super-yum comfort food.  The short rib ravioli is some pot-roasty Goodness, and the long island duck is another great choice.

Our waiter was courteous and provided good, fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering, which was quite nice.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.

Following the cheese tray, I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.

1853,9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA,c_OfFAXTywYkhsV4DgTpSw,"Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!

Our meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).

My two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.

After our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with ""Happy birthday"" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.

We visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.

In sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!",6,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,4,5,2014-12-18,review,10

First time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was pleasant even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the filet mignon. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The filet mignon was perfection. I made BF share with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday.

Second time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal!

Third time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014)
. I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice.

All in all, I love Casbah. I'm a student so it's a little expensive for me. But I go every chance I get. Look out for Big Burrito coupons!",0,2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A,0,4,2014-12-31,review,0

Appetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.

The house-made pastas are always a great option if as is the duck or the lamb which I've had both on a few occasions.

Cons: Not a convenient location for the car-less me, but well that's just me

Hi, I am a non-drinker and rarely have I found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  Granted, Quiet Storm like many Pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  Ginger lemonade?  Yes.  All these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me?  Yeah!

I do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but I attribute that to my love of meaty things).  They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.

Usually good music acts here.  Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends.  Usually 2-3 acts play.  Live.  And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  

The bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.

I have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that.  Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).

Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?

The Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.

AND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.

Anyway, the food here is pretty good.  Sometimes it's better than others, though I think it depends on the cooks.  I'm one of those vegetarians who doesn't much care about reducing kilocalories (the point of eating is to fuel our bodies, right?), so I like the cooks who pile on the mayo and cheese.  I'm sure the cooks who skimp on fattening ingredients have their fan base, too.  The menu is creative, and it feels like the people who make the food are trying to test their cooking chops, which I appreciate.

Hipsters abound (pro or con, depending on who you are) and the place is REALLY child friendly (again, could be a pro or con). But generally, the crowd is mellow, reading, chatting, just enjoying.

The menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). Between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too, not an easy thing to do!

A lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. But my favorite are their dinner salads. They're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not your typical salads. And their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, and always enough food for two.

Oh, and the drink menu! I'm pretty much a water, coffee, beer kind of person, so I haven't tried too much on it. But everything looks amazing.

1875,BnBVuJgAUMm6dZQlSba8dg,8KCWgK8WrfLC4OdrHDj1jg,"For solid veggie/vegan food in Pittsburgh's east end, the QS is a reliable meat-free choice. There are enough good options on the menu that a seasoned QS diner could guide a newbie past the landmines of total-miss dishes, in search of the greener pastures of the spicy peanut tofu wrap and other local faves. The scrambled tofu is a shining star. The kitchen often does remarkable things with potatoes. The salads go above and beyond to woo your heart, with way more toppings & stuff than any other salad I've eaten in Pittsburgh -- this includes salads served with French Fries! Nothing here is fried - even the ""fried"" foods are baked. Your arteries are grateful. The kitchen is unfortunately very inconsistent, and an attentive & caring cook is a very different experience here than the apathetic, distracted or exhausted cook. 

This used to be The Place to Brunch, and I'm sure it's still busy on the weekend mornings, but I had to quit when all these SUV families started monopolizing my fave tables -- apparently the QS made it into some kind of ""VISIT PENNSYLVANIA"" travel guide as a great brunch spot. I hate to be that ""I liked their old stuff better"" kind of a person, but, well... 

Don't be caught unawares- in my cashless world, dinner at the QS means making a special ATM run. 

The QS is super kid-friendly. Books, magazines, and children's toys accompany the wireless internet (which sometimes works, and sometimes doesnt, and no, the staff can't help you). The menu is kid-friendly, the staff is used to dealing with kids, and if you really hate children, you might not want to go there since their peals of laughter and joy might melt your wicked black heart. I wouldn't hesitate to take the 2 year olds or 12 year olds I know. 

The drip coffee is good and bottomless- soy creamer is available. The espresso drinks are really really hit or miss. You may have the tastiest drink you could imagine, or you might be left choking down a $5 drink made by someone who has never drank a cup of coffee. No liquor license but you can BYOB for a nominal charge. 

The service is sometimes swift, but more often lacking. I would never take a date here again --- getting the totally wrong order & waiting half an hour for it to be even acknowledged by the staff is an embarrassment when you tell your date the restaurant is one of your faves. Fortunately, if you are dating me, you probably aren't there for the dinner. 

If you have plenty of time to kill & self-esteem strong enough to weather the whithering glances of the hipper set of pgh's east end, this could be your new fave spot too.

There were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing it's part to support the local community.

Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.

Cash-only makes this even more difficult. Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.

F.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch! I did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing.

It had a very good neighborhood vibe, and everyone working there knew the place and the area really well.
The drink options were pretty great- the coffee was just fine, but the ginger lemonade I ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal. I wish I could have that more often. The food was great; there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what I wanted. I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy with hummus, apples, hot peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole. A big fan of guacamole myself, I was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version. I also really like peas, though, so I was open. And somehow they managed to make it work, and it really did taste very much like guac, with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture. But definitely worth a try. My friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty. She chose the potato salad as her side, and it was the perfect imitation of German potato salad, so I was pretty happy.

The frittata was thicker than any I've seen elsewhere (it looked like a square of lasagna) but very tasty.  I liked the inclusion of sliced potatoes.

The Low Country grits were creamy and also enjoyable, but not too flavorful.  I didn't really taste the fakin' bacon or the garlic supposedly in the dish.  I'm not surprised though,  since a lot of vegetarian places seem to go light on the seasoning.  Definitely ask for cheddar with your grits if you eat dairy.  The three kinds of hot sauce on the table also help perk things up.

No complaints about the service, but they use some sort of chemical cleaner (for the floors or to wipe down the tables, maybe?) that's unpleasant-smelling.  I noticed it less the longer we stayed, maybe because I got food in front of me, but one would hope that a vegetarian establishment might opt for more environmentally friendly and less noxious cleaners.  Other diners were also commenting on the smell when we were there.  I'm guessing this isn't a regular smell to the place, though, since no other reviewers have commented on it.  

The cash-only policy is also a bit of a nuisance, since I'd consider the prices ($11 for brunch entrees) here to be mid-range and not ultra-cheap.  Still, I will come again with my greenbacks.",0,PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g,0,4,2010-06-27,review,1

The 'waitstaff' is hit-or-miss, too. Sometimes, they're great. Other times, I've waited for ages just for a menu. One guy actually snapped at me for asking for a breakfast item at lunch. 

That said, there are some good dishes, like the Black & Gold. I like that in some dishes you can replace rice with salad. A lot of people I've eaten with here have raved about the quesadillas. There's a nice laid back atmosphere and fun retro diner decor.

My friend got the QHF, which is a tofu scramble mixed with home fries and seisage which was absolutely delicious. She also got a side of spicy aioli which went extremely well with the breakfast dish. The service was prompt and they just left pitchers of water on the table for us which was great. Always a great choice for meat-eaters and veggie's alike.

My dinner here consisted of an apple panini and a ""shampoo"", a strange (but delicious!) cherry and almond cream soda. It very well might have taken me 20 minutes or more simply to decide on my beverage of choice - their list was not only long, but offered more innovative choices than I could have ever dreamt up. Among them, an impressive array of Italian sodas (lavender & lemon, mango & lime, white choc & mint, etc.), an enticing selection of lemonades (ginger lemonade, lavender lemonade), and some excellent-sounding tea combinations. To top it off, almost all flavors were available in the form of vegan milkshakes. How they concocted all of these culinary ideas is absolutely beyond me. (I apologize to the coffee drinkers. As a tea drinker myself, I hardly paid attention to that half of the menu.)

The apple panini I ordered came out quickly and was complemented with a side of tortilla chips and salsa. My panini included granny smith apples, apple butter, sharp cheddar, cream cheese, and seisage (vegetarian sausage) atop sun-dried tomato bread (though it seemed more like raisin to me). Never in a million years would I have come up with this strange combination of flavors, but it definitely worked. As described in the menu, indeed it was ""highly addictive"".

For vegetarian food in Pittsburgh, I say this place is aces. But compared to the many other veggie restaurants I've been to in this past, this place is average. It's really hit and miss with their dishes. When at a veggie place, I usually try to change it up each time I go to keep my diet varied. This has proven to be a little difficult at Quiet Storm because it seems every other time I get something I don't like. Apple Panini is amazing. Nachos are great! Curry wasn't spicy enough. Grits runny. Milkshakes YUM! I feel like the cooks don't have a good handle on cooking tofu there. Different dishes require tofu to be cooked for different lengths of time and it different sauces, and it has always tasted bizarre when I get it there. Sometimes its not pressed and cooked long enough. Sometimes its dried out! How can tofu get dried out? This is coming from someone who LOVES tofu. I can eat silken tofu straight out of the package with a little soy sauce and sugar.
If you have spent anytime in Portland, Oregon... the atmosphere in this place is very Portland. Outdoorsy hipster cafe style. It's loud, but I couldn't imagine it another way.

Normally I'd find this annoying, as I'm an unabashed and unapologetic meat eater. That doesn't mean I don't love a good veggie dish, but fake meat masquerading as real meat is one of my pet peeves. If you're going to serve vegetarian food, don't try to pretend it's anything else.

That grievance having been aired, I ordered the Blackadilla, a quesadilla boasting no false meat items, but stuffed with black beans, basmati rice, sweet potatoes, pineapple and cheddar cheese. It was delicious and filling, and at $8 for the enormous quesadilla and a small house salad, a pretty good deal. 

The menu at Quiet Storm is large, with breakfast and lunch/dinner items as well as an array of cafe drinks and desserts. In spite of the prevalence of seitan and tofu, there are a number of dishes that I look forward to sampling upon return.

And I do plan to return. As those of you who have read my other Yelp reviews know, the atmosphere of public places is very important to me, and the atmosphere at Quiet Storm does not disappoint. It's got a retro cool '50s diner vibe and a more modern but equally cool soundtrack that entices customers to stick around. The wait staff encourages this practice, giving diners plenty of space to hang out long after they've finished eating.

The one downside of Quiet Storm is its location, floating among gas stations and abandoned houses in Garfield, an area sandwiched between the more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods of Bloomfield and East Liberty, but not quickly accessible from either.

I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What's not to love, right? 

Well, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on!

Maybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the ""firesticks"" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.

We had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes.

The Spectre of Laziness is a dick, but he was also right.  And to my surprise, nothing I had was bad at all.  For brunch options, meat eaters will find that potatoes and eggs are the cornerstone of any breakfast, and seitan substitutions are not as bad as say, having the grim Spectre of Laziness point out your slovenly appearance.  

I think the biggest surprise in this place is that, though nothing is particularly jarring to the palate, there is nothing that really stands out as being amazing.  In Yelp terms: it's kind of a 3.  For hard core vegetarians having a night, er, mid-afternoon on the town, it's probably a blessed change from the meat based culture that Pittsburgh is pretty famous for.

1933,2YHVTrs6EY7Me9NwxiQVpQ,wMFWtOQ3suHx7geG2hozAg,"Honestly, this the last place you'd ever expect to see me. First it's a vegan/veggie cafe, I am a complete carnivore. Secondly, it's like hipster brunch paradise, I'm super preppy (a heavily tattoed preppy person but still).  Yet this was one of the only places open on Labor Day and I walked in with my vegan friend, she immediately recognized her people and practically jizzed in her pants over the menu. OMG seitan gravy and cheez?

WTF is seitan gravy and cheez? Why does she keep calling vegan cheese, ""cheez"" anyway? I decided to go with the flow and order the Home Fries Ranchero. Basically their ""famous"" home fries, chili, sour cream, eggs or tofu and cheez. I went native and ordered tofu vs eggs, and you know what? I liked it. It came out in a big heaping pile on a 70s retro plastic plate, accompanied with some awesome coffee. My friend had hummus and pita, cause not only is she vegan she only eats things in the white/beige color range (food racist).

One bad thing, the bathroom has no door, only the stall does. Basically it's a unisex bathroom where all the delightful sounds and smells can be experienced by diners directly in front of you. For a place that serves chili and ""cheez"" they may want to reconsider this open approach.

There are some previous reviews about arrogant hipsters/bad service etc. I have say our waitress was awesome and attentive. My coffee was filled routinely, she understood that requesting a ""buttload"" of cream meant a larger carafe of cream rather than a thimble. The host was apologetic for making us wait for more than a few minutes to sit down.I do admit it does have the indie coffee house feel, and yes hipsters abound here, but I have a feeling these are some legit hipsters. Not the trust fund having, whiny, I drink PBR, and annoy people with my smugness style hipster.  I bet these hipsters been squezzing their junk into tight pants long before I was born. I don't know, I just get that impression.

My girlfriend is a veg-head aka vegetarian and had wanted to visit Quiet Storm for a while.  When we finally visited this week, I was pleasantly surprised.  There is definitely an old-time diner feel with a bit of arts and crafts mixed in.  If you're reading this, chances are that you have some notion of the crunchy/hipster/longhair reputation of this place and that perception is certainly accurate to a degree but I did not find the service pretentious or slow at all, as some have noted.  Our server was attentive, although there were only about seven folks in the place (it was off hours, about 4 PM on a Monday.)  I enjoyed the apple panini with seisage (a maiden voyage for me), apple butter, cream cheese and cheddar.  The apple butter, which seemed almost an add-on when I looked at the menu, was actually the star here and the sandwich comes on sundried tomato bread that really adds a lot of flavor to a very simple idea.  My only complaint is about the size of the sandwich.  It could have been larger.  My girlfriend ordered a burrito that was honestly huge and she found it tasty and worthy of a doggie bag.  I would definitely go back and would like to try their weekend brunch, which is supposedly quite good.

(Seriously, The Demolished Man is good.) It also fit in perfectly with the blue collar/gentrified charm of Pittsburgh in general, and the Hill District/Lawrenceville/Bloomfield in particular.

The Cheesy Snake -- a vegetarian cheese steak -- can be made with vegan cheese, and it's pretty slammin, too.

I got the smashed potatoes with seitan, cheese, and aioli.  The first bite was OK--the aioli didn't quite suit my taste, but everything else worked pretty well together.  However, 20 some-odd bites in to the dish, the flavors were getting repetitive and the mushy texture started to gross me out.  I got about half-way through eating the dish and the so-so aioli became too much for me.  I couldn't take another bite.

However, my wife's apple panini was delicious.  I would probably eat a few of those if I came back.  The cream cheese, cinnamon (from the bread?), and apple all worked together in glorious harmony.

On a strange note, while we were eating, some camera guys came in and started setting up what looked to be an interview.  We asked the staff what was going on.  Apparently someone was filming their submission/application to be on a reality show.  ""Oh cool,"" we thought.  ""What reality show?"" we asked.  ""Not sure, something on the Golf Channel,"" they replied.  HAHAHAHA!  I thought watching grass growing on TV was boring enough.  Now they're making a reality show about it.

But let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to ""look in the back"" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.

To be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn't anything special.  Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.

Anyway, ordered my latte - good espresso, but pretty weak foam. Served in a pint glass. That's fine. 

Menu actually looked really good, so I went for a sammy with apples, seitan sausage crumbles, and cheese. They offer different sides, but my super hipster server guy didn't ask me what I wanted; so being a newbie I figured maybe that was only with certain menu items. I was wrong, when the guy taking care of the table behind me was asked what he wanted. My fault for not speaking up. Sandwich was good, not to die for though, and frankly kinda small for $8.

I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate...

But what I really came here to talk about are the milkshakes. OHEMGEE. I don't even know how to describe them to you. The vegan ones are just delectably decadent and so thick that you can barely drink it through a straw.

In that it does some things right, but none of the important things.  It has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright, so that's good.  They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place.  Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker.  I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well.  If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume?

They had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to.  They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those.  I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful.  There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here.

I go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note.  It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast.  As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers ""D.C.""  The waiter replies, ""Oh, I'm sorry about that.""  Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there.  So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city.  Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are.

I couldn't resist putting cheese on the otherwise vegan burger, but still felt very healthy eating such a veggie-filled dinner! Their milkshakes also looked amazing - I would have tried one but I needed something to warm me up instead so I got a latte, which was also very good.

In fact, there was no wait at all when the six of us popped in a little after noon on the weekend. Odd, but my group was hungry so we didn't question the kismet. 

The restaurant is pretty enormous as far as cafes go, and it's nice because they don't pack the tables on top of each other so you're never going to be crammed next to a crying baby or having to scoot your chair in every time the table next to you needs a coffee refill. The furnishings all appear to be second hand finds as well as local art and LOTS of owl statues. It's a hoot, for sure. 

One weird thing is the one bathroom with the sink outside, so if you're sitting in the back you can heavily monitor who comes out and doesn't wash their poopy hands. On the other hand, if you go to the bathroom here you'll likely feel like you have to make your hand washing some sort of big production so the other people in the back will take notice of your exceptional hygiene habits.

I was feeling pretty sick still and actually brain washed myself  into believing that my weekend bug was actually morning sickness so on top of already feeling super nauseous and not hungry, and naturally my non-motherly instincts wanted to starve whatever demon might be brewing inside me but the hypothetical baby's daddy insisted I eat something and took it upon himself to order me the tofu scramble, which I was sort of excited to try despite feeling otherwise very green. It was actually very bland and dry and even though I think it was only like $3, I think I would have rather had the $3 in my pocket than the scramble so I took a few bites and then pawned it off on the boo who insisted I try his veggie breakfast burrito. The burrito was the total opposite of the scramble- absolutely outstanding and even though it was the size of a guinea pig, I think I could have downed the whole thing (of course, I would have blamed it on my imaginary incubating child and said I was eating for two). 

Going around the table, everyone seemed content with their food, besides the grits order that were decidedly bland, but that's kind of how I've come to think of grits in general. Our service was great and though most of the table's food was just okay, that burrito, the owl statues and the house horchata I ordered as my beverage really made the experience for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can understand the 3-star average on Yelp, but that I think you can totally come here and have a 4 or even 5 star time if you order wisely. Just remember: Burrito, horchata and time the bathroom-goers for extra entertainment.

A small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But ""Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings"" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their ""chorizo"" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed ""foods.""

Less processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, ""Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat""? I have! But don't expect that feeling here.

I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.

The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan ""cheese"" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal.

All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. 

Quiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible.

I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.
 
4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing.

I reeeeeally wanted a smoothie, so I opted out of the milkshake (I know, a rare occasion), and went with a iced chai. I love that they make their own mix of chai and they also don't sweeten it, so you can sweeten it yourself. Super sweet chai is super gross. Just sayin'. 

I also ordered the Sesame Noodle Platter (noodles, soy, tofu, red cabbage, mushrooms, broccoli, onions, peppers) with a ginger carrot salad. It was a solid meal. I mean, it wasn't necessarily a platter (I think a variety of separate items), but a noodle dish. I liked that there was a decent amount of veggies and not just a few, with a massive amount of noodles. I hate when that happens! It was also lightly sauced, not too heavy and sticky. Plus the fried tofu was awesome! Honestly, I've never had such good tofu before. I rarely get it because I think tofu can be so bland, but this was bomb!

One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.

The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:
Fiori's
Pizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch)
Pizza Perfectta
Aiello's (Murray Street)
Beto's

Save for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.

Okay, not the worst pizza ever, but it's pretty far down my list of pizzerias...and that's sad, considering I quite literally live across the street from it. This should be my go-to pizza destination but I'd rather pay a delivery charge than eat their pizza. The sauce is way too sweet (like, Papa Johns sweet) and there isn't enough cheese. There are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this. The only thing I enjoy about Pizza Perfectta is that their sign hilariously claims, ""Excitingly flavored!"" Personally, I wasn't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza. Maybe if they wouldn't have tempted me with such language I would be less pissed off at them.

I was happy to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed.  Upon opening it I was also pleased to see that the slice was pretty large.  The pizza itself ended up being really solid.  On it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating.  The crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy.  Finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some good flavor to it.

It's the best place to buy spices because they're sold in bulk, and if you want to try something new or only need a little for a recipe, you don't have to buy a whole bottle. There is an entire aisle of spices, spice blends and dried herbs, so there is a lot to choose from. It's also great to buy a little at a time because you can make sure your spices are always fresh. Same goes for the bulk food bins, though probably half of them are the 9,000 flavors of granola they stock.

The salad bar has great variety. The hot food bar, not so much. It runs out quickly, and it's too easy to run up a high tab if the good stuff is weighty.

I randomly found out about East End when I was doing a search for organic, local food products. We decided to go check it out and instantly fell in love. Their produce selection is second-to-none, seriously. And yes, I am including Giant Eagle in that!

Seriously, just about every time we've gone all the produce looks so fresh and brightly colored (i.e., the peppers, tomatoes, fruits, etc.) and ripe. I also like how they carry pasta noodles, rice, and other fun things in bulk. We always lament about how since there's only the two of us, we don't always need the large offerings that you usually find at places like Giant Eagle. Being able to pick out just the amount you need and not letting anything go to waste makes me feel a lot better.

Beyond the food products, I have also gotten into making my own body washes. East End carries all of the ingredients that I need with multiple options. They have recently redone their store (and are still renovating) and have expanded their meat (they didn't use to carry meat at all) and cheese selections tremendously. The meat is a little pricey, actually the whole store is little pricey, but in my opinion it is well worth it. It's nice knowing that the items are organic and come from sustainable farms. Bonus: they buy as much locally produced items as they can as well. 

I really have nothing bad to say about them. The service has always been great and I love the selections and products offered. I can't comment on the cafe as I haven't eaten at it, but I hear the food is great. A combination of East End and the Strip has pretty much replaced Giant Eagle for me.

If I had to choose between the Co-op and WF, the Co-op is where it's at.

There is a good selection of fruits and veggies, as well as toiletries (shampoos, soaps, toothpaste, tampons, shaving creams, etc.) to household cleaning products. The frozen section is also very diverse with a good selection of frozen meals, ice cream (dairy and nondairy), and veggies. The Co-op also carries a nice selection of foods for people with restricted diets especially for Celiac and vegans, or for people with severe allergies like myself. 

They also carry hard to find vegan cheeses such as Treeline that I have difficulty finding at WF in Pittsburgh and the Co-op in West Virginia. I was also happy to find that they had my favorite Ito-En sencha green tea shot (it's just green tea in a can, it's not like one of those energy shots at all). 

The deli is also fantastic, and I highly recommend the Co-op deli over the WF deli. There are a wide variety of soups and salads and dressings. The vegan mushroom soup is really, really, really yummy. There are also vegan meals in ready to go containers (salads, vegan pesto noodle salad, etc.). You can also order coffee/espresso at the deli counter. As with any good Co-op, they have a variety of non-dairy milk options. 

If you have food allergies or have any dietary restrictions the Co-op is an excellent place to get a quick meal (hot or cold) and to pick up groceries. There is also a little dining/sitting area at the front of the store. It's kid friendly and they even have a little compost/recycling bin! Yes, this is important for me to mention because I come from Seattle where recycling is the norm and we get fined if we don't recycle..and recycling does not seem to be a big thing in WV where I currently live. 

There is also a community board if you are looking to post something up (events, classes, pet sitting, etc.) near the bathroom in the back of the store.",0,-iVcmhjfq79QoTWzrb6pKg,0,5,2014-06-08,review,0

We were a little confused as to how to get into the co-op, because didn't realize that it was on the opposite street all tucked away. After we figured that out by following another patron, we were really excited to walk through the doors. 

If you've never been into a co-op, you should know that they are typically smooshed together and have an interesting smell that emanates from the bulk-spices isle. I love this smell. It's really the best grocery store smell, EVER.

Proceeding through the store we noticed the colorful and abundant produce section. So many beautiful fruits, veggies and herbs. The prices varied, but they were probably on par with what you would pay for any other organic produce somewhere else. 

When we found the back area with hot foods, cold foods and the smoothies...I died of happiness. There were so many wonderful things back there. The food bar is $7.99 a pound, which is a lot cheaper than some places! The smoothies were all very tasty sounding, but I settled on a smoothie with soy ice cream, strawberries and papaya juice. Oh, my, god. It was so delicious! My boyfriend got the King smoothie, and he really enjoyed his too.

Right beside the smoothie bar there is a section for all kinds of books. My eye was caught by an organic and local homebrewing book. It is now on my list of must haves! 

The rest of the store was great. I especially love the cheese selection (we bought AMAZING and LOCAL tomato-basil havarti), the vegan meat products and the prices.

I first came to know these guys after encountering the office manager Linda at my place of work. After talking to her for a few minutes and finding out where she worked I started to tell her of my recent woes with ANOTHER dentist... a botched filling, an infection, a great deal of pain and the need for a root canal. Linda gave me the office's card and insisted that they would see me ASAP if I so desired. I did and it was a great decision, because relief soon followed.  

I have never had an appointment with these guys that I have not found to be an enjoyable experience. OK...I know that's saying a lot, due to the amount of poking and prodding and rather invasive metal hooks and drills that we all associate with a dentists office, but I'm serious. Everyone in this office from the front desk, the hygienists and the good Doctor himself, are all experts at what they do. The wait times are minimal. Usually, less than ten minutes. It's very rare that a doctor's office will respect the time of their patients in this fashion. There is always a courtesy call to remind you of your appointment a day or two in advance. The work is top notch + the location next to the Co-op is as geographically desirable and  as you can get.

I could go on and on, but instead I'm just going to close by saying, if you are looking for a dentist, you may have just stumbled upon the best one in the Burgh.

2142,LmZ1Cwt5HMBiWv9nXjcHag,NeyqP6GHZ9sx7FwfOQegtw,"Very primitive bouldering area, but the routes were challenging, in part due to the lack of a smearable surface (plywood kinda painted to look like rocks),  mega shitty footholds (jibs worn down to shiny scummy nubs that sorely needed cleaning or replacing), and a distinct lack of fall-friendliness (one old mat to be shared among every 3 or 4 walls, and an unforgiving floor that thudded every time someone landed on it).  Not a bargain for a $12 day pass since the routes did not seem to have been changed very often and all climbs shared the same foot jibs which looked practically permanent. The changing room was literally a closet.

2143,4g2cLpxNR6r7H-kh6iozlQ,tP4-E5-1jzsoW_0dth34ZA,"PROS
- Tons of space and tons of gentle-ish climbs for the beginner/novice/padawan. Looots of V0, VB, V1, V2s... I think the hardest I saw was a V7. I don't boulder much more than a V2, and I found a lot of fun, challenging courses. It wore me out, but I felt like a superstar. (My local climbing gym is a lot harder.) That was great!
- They offer to play your music! I always appreciate that in a gym. It's cool to hear other people's tastes, it's cool to let my tastes get some air, and indeed one tires of the alt 90s Pandora station.
- That said, I did feel some Interpol-sounding pixie dust bewitch my ear drums. And I appreciate that. I always appreciate being able to rock out/feel cool while simultaneously lunging for the next hold.
- $16 for a day pass and shoes was not terrible. It wasn't great, either, but it wasn't terrible. (And what's in between a pro and a con?)
- Easy parking.


CONS
- A lot of the walls felt way too tall to be lacking a top rope. I'd guess some of the tallest walls were 10 ft. - and, dude, falling 10 feet on a (bouncy) floor is still super dangerous, especially if you fall in between a Tarzan lunge (and thus, awkwardly). They had a few mats which were ""strategically positioned"" and thus couldn't be moved, but even with those under me, I didn't feel so good. They felt little thicker than a down comforter. Dude, come on! I didn't break my neck, but my muscles were all a-trembly, my hands slick with sweat, and it was sheer terror that often kept me from lunging (Tarzan-style) to the next hold. I had to give up on a few climbs just because I didn't feel safe! And that is very lame. I would have felt a LOT safer if the 6+ ft. walls were just top rope-able, or if they bought some bigger, thicker mats and let people drag them around. A free helmet's not gonna help much if you land on your shoulder!
- I saw a kid wandering around who looked adorable, pubescent and a little intimidated. It seemed like his first time. It broke my heart, 'cuz he seemed to have gotten frustrated after trying a few of the climbs and not being able to get very far. I think he left after not very long. Does the gym offer kids classes? Or one-on-one instruction, especially if the person's totally new and under 15 or something? It just seemed like such a shame; I'd hate to have a kid get sour on climbing just because they had an awkward first time! People need to be taught this stuff! (To an extent.)
- $2 for the privilege of chalk. Seriously?

I do really enjoy going here and go at least once a week. I go mostly in the evenings, where the crowd is primarily a young adult group and you rarely see children.

I've been climbing a bit longer than I had been when I first wrote this review, but I still give it 3 stars. If I could give it a 2.5 I might give it that.

The bourldering room is pretty big and there are lots of routes at a variety of levels, distributed more of less so that each wall has something for everyone. In the evenings it gets uncomfortably crowded, and has gotten worse in the past few years as the sport has seemed to get more and more popular. What gets me the most is that in the 2 years or so that I've been going here, very little has changed. Meanwhile, I've been exploring gyms all over the country that are expanding, have textured rather than plywood walls so you can actually smear, and have incorporated things like yoga and weight rooms into their memberships. Why can't Pittsburgh have that?

I hope one day the climbing wall will step up to try and become one of the more progressive gyms you see on the west coast, or that someone else moves a gym into the city that will up the ante.

The bouldering area is huge, and on a Saturday afternoon surprisingly empty with no need to wait for any route. It's labeled from V0 upwards... although the floor is padded, the walls do go up pretty high (the 10ft estimate from before is accurate), so a fall would be pretty scary... they do give you an option to wear a helmet, but I saw nobody doing so.

The routes are all clearly marked, and difficulty seemed to correspond with rating - there are also a ton to choose from, so you won't get bored. One staff member in particular was amazing - Allen - who spent the time giving climbing tips and encouragement to whomever needed it. Costs are also reasonable ($12/day, + $3/shoes, $2/chalk), and it's located in a nice strip mall with the East End Co-Op nearby for food. Overall, not a bad place to spend an afternoon!",0,5V1K5DRpGrObijbtCuPbcg,0,4,2012-02-11,review,0
2147,u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow,b2obCvbA0DijLc0ys0kAuw,"I'm giving this the ok rating, I am not an experienced climber but a beginner. The last climb I went out was a real one in Utah with my brother who got me all harnessed up only to instruct me to place my foot and hand level with my head and pull myself up . You can imagine how that went with my golden retriever feverish barking and running below instructing my brother to let me down lol.

So for a beginner I found the price to be ok I went with a group and paid 16$ for shoe rental and I guess climbing fee? We stayed for about two hours. We went on a Saturday it was very crowded probably 15-30 people in the place but there are so many choices you can still get a wall. There were several beginner climbs that are easy for anyone with a shred of upper body strength. Then some V2 and V3 and V4, the other beginner gals I was climbing with found there was a pretty big variation from the VB to V2 on some of the climbs. So sometimes it was better just not to follow the stickers completely if you're a beginner but still looking for variation while bouldering. 

I think safety-wise things are bit of a liability here, walls are high, mats are very old and very few. Also lots of people don't follow the basic rules including teenagers who are there alone. So be cautious of your space an d others space and consider fatigue when getting to the top of those walls with your hands all sweaty. 

I also expected it to be a little larger based on the website photos, but I understand that this is Pittsburgh not a city with room for a huge gym like out west. I also think if they were to build a bigger newer gym here with higher climbs, then you would be looking at paying $25 and up. 

My biggest complaint is that you can only do lessons at certain times with a harness, this makes it harder for beginners to get in and get a feel. I did complete one or two V7 or V8. Just to push myself but I would have had more fun if I had the support of a rope so the next time I go back I will consider classes. Which costs a little bit more but oh well.

-A one-day pass is $12.  College students/active military pay $10.  Wednesday is 1/2 price for ladies (but only after they pay full price on the first visit).  Wednesday is also 1/2 price for guys who wear a sports bra.  Yup, you heard me right.  Wednesdays are usually pretty crowded.

-They run a different membership special every month.  If you climb more than once a week, a membership can definitely be worth it.

-If it's your first time at the wall, I highly suggest just doing the ""bouldering certification"" instead of the ""safety and belay certification class.""  The bouldering certification takes about 5 minutes and then you can start climbing.  Decide if you like it, then do the belay certification.

-If you ""like"" them on facebook, you can get updates about when they change the routes, what membership specials they're running, if they're selling any old/used shoes for discounted prices, etc.

Pricing is reasonable, especially on Wednesdays, which is ladies night--$6 to climb (after your first visit).  Other days the price is $12 or $10 for students/military plus the cost of equipment rentals.  If you plan on going at least once a week (or more often like me) buying a membership is the way to go, and there are different specials each month.

Cons:
- I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. 
- I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: ""Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped."" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly ""If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them."" I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing.

2166,FHofjlnlxqdvSSkQ6UkNZw,0AtpPhZzXvILaou-xzvpsg,"I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing.  They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs.

Dreams crushed.  Only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room.  I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.

So we bouldered.  The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another.  You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss.  With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion.  Those were only on the overhanging walls.

The place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.  I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's).

Side note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area.  Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully.

I expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh.",0,5V1K5DRpGrObijbtCuPbcg,0,1,2014-12-08,review,1
2167,5V8gktabBuWHoB83oFo_fw,VBTOldZkkfLuHw3z7Getqg,"There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall, but overall I was quite disappointed.  I wanted to like this place, so I'll start with the positive aspects.  

First of all, the gym in pretty cheap.  And the bouldering area is really quite good.  To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area.  Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. 

It seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent.  I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon.  The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. 


Now the downsides.  The staff wasn't very helpful.  The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test.  It's poor form. 

The ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull.  They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground.  I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. 

The walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible.  Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned.  Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous.  

There's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean.  I believe there is some potential here, but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole, a missed opportunity.",0,5V1K5DRpGrObijbtCuPbcg,0,2,2014-12-15,review,2

This is a Tony Pais restaurant, he owns another more formal place downtown but I forget the name.  He used to own Baum Vivant on Baum Blvd.  This was a great place.  The last I was there was 7 or 8 years ago.  It was total formal fuu fuu fine dining, but what an experience.  Anyways, it's gone now and I haven't been to one of his places since until last night when a friend suggested we try this little oasis located on Spahr St.  This place is the opposite with respect to atmosphere than Baum Vivant.  It's in a converted garage with a few outdoor tables.  It's cash only and BYOB.  It's very informal and I got away with wearing tennis shoes and my ""Super Size My Foie Gras"" fruit of the loom t-shirt.  Don't need to get dressed up to enjoy amazing food.  The inside of the restaurant/garage has a high ceilings and an eclectic mix of non-matching tables that I imagine were collected from Thrift stores.  The service was awesome, spot on from start to finish.  The lovely european women who served and hosted had big smiles and a genuine appreciation when we said we liked the food.  The meal started with some warm rolls that they may cook on site.  It was served with ice cold butter.  That's fine, but let's get a little more creative people on the butter, dips with the bread.  The first course was this amazing artichoke soup.  This literally is the best soup I've tried since I can remember and I eat out all the time.  The flavor was layored with the cream, maybe nutmeg, maybe spinach, and also what tasted to me like a shellfish broth.  It was a very complex flavor.  Amazing!  Next was a goat cheese dish served inside of phyllo dough.  It was tasty, but a little too rich for my taste.  The inside of the dough had apricots mixed with the goat cheese and the sauce was some type of combination of walnuts and apples pureed'.  Interesting, but didn't add too much to the dish.  Also, we tried a smoked salmon appetizer served on croutons with capers.  It was perfect and I really like their portions here.  They don't try to kill you with the size of the dishes.  My friend ordered the crabcakes, which were two small mostly lump crabmeat portions.  They were delicious served with a mushroom cream sauce.  The rice that was served with the crabcakes were another story, totally tasteless and not seasoned well. The rice was also a liitle mushy.  I tried the Elysian Fields lamb burger.  I had never seen an Elysian Fields lamb burger, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was a decent portion (4 oz. I'd guess) at a reasonable price $11.  I didnt' really get to tell the difference between regular lamb and Elysian because they overcooked the burger to well done and it lost much of the flavor.  Overall, I'll stick to Tessaro's for my burgers.  We finished with a chocolate mousse, which was okay but I thought too heavy for a mousse.  I got out of here with a $65 + tax bill for all this amazing food.  What's even better is that because it's byob I probably saved $30 for the bottle of wine as well.  I really like the fact I can have interesting food, relatively cheap in a casual atmosphere.  One last thing, they don't have AC so you may want to pick a cooler night if you plan on sitting indoors.

The calamari appetizer had plenty of calamari and was very good.

The Zinho salad was just OK, which was our single disappointment. On the plus side, it had artichokes and hearts of palm. On the downside, we could have prepared it at home easily; the olives were from a can and tasted bland.

Like everywhere we end up going, we go because a Yelp review we have read, that inspired us to give it a try.  We new it was BYOB, but we weren't in the mood for drinking, so we walked on over.  It was our own fault that we got there, at 5:00pm, on the dot - and they were not quite ready to be opened, as they were finishing setting up the tables.  My boyfriend and I took a quick walk around Ellsworth.  It's a family-owned business where they turned their front garage into the most charming, artsy-like, romantic restaurant.  We'll cut them some slack!

When we got back, they were ready for us; and we chose to snag a table outside (they thought we were nuts).  However, in one of the reviews, we read that they had no A/C, which was a big selling point for us (I absolutely loathe going into a freezing cold, A/C'd out restaurant, and being forced to bring a hoodie with me, when it's 90+ outside.  And we do kind of like hot, humid, and muggy); but, I guess they have upgraded because the A/C was BLASTING on the inside of the restaurant.

We started off with the Gazpacho.  This was a perfect summer starter because it was cool, extremely flavorful, and a natural air conditioner to the body.  It had lumps of shrimp and crab meat at the bottom, which made us feel like we were eating somewhere on Duval St. in Key West.  I normally don't like cilantro, but the cilantro was so subtle and completely rounded out the flavor.  When our waitress brought out the freshly baked loaf of corn bread, we sopped up the rest of it.  It is true, the wait staff genuinely appreciates your compliments and feels honored every time you say you enjoyed something.

I ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger.  When our dishes came out, they were the most beautiful dishes I had ever seen - full of color, wonderful portion sizing, and aromas just attacking the olfactory with sensational goodness.  My Ravs were topped with this grape tomato paquillo sauce, which tasted like it had hints of red pepper also.  It was FANTASTIC.  Plus, there were whole mushrooms, okra, carrots, and cauliflower on top of the dish as well.  I don't know what kind of separate seasonings were on the veggies, but they were to-die-for also.  I can't exactly remember how many Ravs were in my bowl, but every time I thought I was finished, there was another ravioli to be found, and then another.  For the price - I think there were a total of 10 fully-stuffed, hand-made mushroom ravs.  Incredible.

My boyfriend's Lamb Burger came with a cranberry and raisin jam (but ""jam"" seems to cliché of a word for this topping), and a salad that had slices of apples in it.  Now I'm usually not one to eat sweeter tasting foods; however, the complementing of sweet and savory in this dish blew my mind.  I'm also not a big fruit eater (unless it's blended in a smoothie), but I totally got past all that because the flavors and the textures all are playing nicely with one another.

We opted out of dessert because we were so stuffed.  But our bill for an appetizer and two filling, insanely delicious entrees came to $40.  DING DING DING DING DING!  WE HAVE FOUND A WINNER!  

After dinner the owner came over to our table and we were introduced.  What a wonderful, sweet, and genuine older guy.  We will definitely be back before the menu changes again; and next time, we're going for entrees and dessert!!

After passing by Cafe Zinho for years and years I finally hopped into a hidden Portuguese oasis. Who knew the little hole in the wall near my old hair salon had such good food?! My friends and I had known long about it, but last night we were in need of a BYOB ($5 corkage) and found much more than that. 

We started with two appetizers. (A very good tip from a fellow yelper!) One friend is majorly allergic to gluten and our fabulous waiter MORE than accommodated her questions and requests with patience. We all shared some kind of rice stuffed pepper that was moist and exploding with flavor, I forget the name...but definitely a must-have. We also were excited to try the pan-sauteed (not fried) calamari. I'm not a huge fried calamari fan, but this was swimming in olive oil and fresh herbs...it was a lovely delight away from a typically americanized version. 

We also ordered the tomato bisque and the soup of the day. These were insane! The best soups I've ever had out. The soup of the day was a roasted creamy mushroom soup and I almost licked my bowl clean. The flavors were outstanding and we all couldn't decide which soup was better. Make sure to definitely soak everything up with their delicious table bread that seemed to have just come out of the oven every time they replenished our basket! 

Something worth passing is yes, the salads...they're just okay. But my friends raved about their pork and I will not forget the visual of my friend picking up the bone to lick it clean while our waiter just laughed at us! :) 

Best part of the story? Well, the food takes a lonnggg time to come out, (warning, but probably because it is so fresh!) after finishing our bottle, our neighboring diners also took advantage of the BYOB but seemed to have left half of theirs when they were done! So after a silly little dare, we became the table of three that snuck 3 large pours of wine and placed it back on their table! Hey! Who was going to drink it anyways?! The little portuguese owner came over and was sincerely shocked at how the wine bottle was empty...she asked, ""Did you three drink this?"" We giggled and my friend's boyfriend said, ""YES.""

I don't think I would have stumbled upon this place just upon chance. I made a reservation for three on a Tuesday night at 7. My two friends were already there and then... there was just me in the restaurant, which scared me a little bit but I have to have faith in my fellow Yelpers. 

The waitress was an adorable woman who was so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic about the dishes in a quiet manner. You just wanted to pinch her cheeks or something. Anyway she gave us some bread which was sweet, unlike many of the other restaurants breads that I have had, which I enjoyed. We ordered the goat cheese for an appetizer which was just so ooey and gooey deliciousness and then for the piece de resistance ordered the sea bass special that night which had capers, a potato, rice and some roasted vegetables. Great light combination and not too heavy. The size of the sea bass was like of the entire whole fish. To top it off we had the rice pudding dessert which was similar to flan but I thought this was so tasty. I kind of want one right now as I am typing this review.

I have driven by it many times without even realizing it was a restaurant. 

Thankfully, my more knowledgeable girlfriend recommended checking it out, as she had to buy me dinner. Cruel world, I know.

We were able to get an early reservation on a Saturday, pick up a bottle of wine ( a must!) and make it relatively on time. Intimate is precisely the word I would use to describe this living room dining experience. The waitresses are what you would want your host mom to be like from a foreign country, and splendidly cheery.

We ordered two apps, both delicious. They also served some impeccable cornbread as well. The first app was a pastry sort of thing covered in goat cheese, that was worthy of plate licking, had it been socially acceptable. The second was a batch of clams in a fragrant tomato sauce (the sauce also went well on the goat cheese pastry). Most of the time when I order clams, they are far too fishy, but these were perfect.

The lady friend ordered the special, a quail dish, while I ordered lamb osobuco. The portions were very generous, and you could easily see the care and prep that went into each individual dish. I must say, the quail was divine. I ended up super jealous and contemplated tricking the gf to turn around so I could switch plates while she was distracted. It was a mixture of sweet and layered with spices, the meat juicy and rich. 

The lamb was textured and cooked very well, however it seemed to lack a distinctive flavor to bring out the qualities of the meat itself. Perhaps more garlic or such.


Either way, I will return, maybe with some Portuguese phrases in hand to banter with my adopted foreign mom/waitress.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,4,2012-04-24,review,0

I called and they said they were quite busy but if I could get there quickly, they had an open table for us.  Before hanging up they reminded me to bring a bottle of wine if I wanted one.  We made a quick stop at the nearby wine and spirits shoppe, bought a Spanish red, and showed up at Cafe Zinho.  They offered us the choice of two tables and immediately opened our wine, and brought over two nice stems.  The waiter gave us menus, described the daily specials and gave us time to mull it over.  We both ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin bisque, my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree, and I chose a lamb burger (not Elysian Fields lamb, I asked).  Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread.  It had a delicious sweetness. Our soups came out fairly quickly.  The bowls held a hearty serving of the delicious (and filling) cream soup.  After clearing our empty bowls our waiter bought out our entrees.  My wife's side salad was large, as side salads go.  She was quite pleased with it.  It had baby greens, tomato, olives, hearts & reduced red wine vinaigrette.  I had a taste and agreed with her assessment.  My lamb burger was huge!  It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney.  It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger.  Note to self- do not order a salad if you're going to order the lamb burger!  I ordered the burger cooked medium-well, even though the waiter sort of tried to talk me into medium.  It came out just the way I wanted it, with just a hint of pink in the middle, and full of delicious juices.  My wife agreed that it was extremely yummy!  I cut the burger in half and managed to eat one of the halves along with about half the salad before I ran out of room.  My wife made it about halfway thru her salad by then, and she too gave up.  We asked for doggie bags and our waiter packed our meals up in containers and put them in a plastic bag for us.  It was a very nice meal and dining experience.  We noticed that the hostess greeted most people who came thru he door by name.  Obviously there are a large group of regulars who dine here often.
Pros: BYOB, tasty food, reasonable noise level, outdoor sidewalk dining is available seasonally, friendly and attentive service (if a bit unpolished).
Cons:  Ambience (it originally was a gas station) and there is nothing fancy about the funky decor, tables are packed every which way into the available interior space.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,4,2012-10-06,review,0

Menu was somewhat limited, although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. I ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. The stew had seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and some type of summer sausage, but not much else. The broth was oily. My husband's chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy.

2203,1zJL9PogiFyd_NhGcbgs7Q,fHK4RZvuTuOvFc1gkwcxcg,"This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  ""chicken maputo
Roasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce"".  Does the average diner know what ""maputo"" and ""piri piri"" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.

I posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.

The Portuguese bread served before our meal was crusty, warm, and special -- a cross between a French loaf and cornbread. Unfortunately, things went down hill from here. The highly recommended goat cheese and phyllo dough tart was too rich and too mild, The pears didn't give enough sweetness and there wasn't any salt. So, it was just creamy. Plain and creamy.  

Between us we had three entrees. The salmon was my favorite of the three. It was an interesting preparation and well done. But, nothing special. The monk fish special was too sweet for my taste and a bit tough. (I don't want to have to use a knife to cut my fish.)

Before I talk about the food, however, I want to explain why I'm giving Zinho only 4 stars. There are two major factors that negatively affected my overall experience. First, for a restaurant as expensive as Zinho (somewhere between $80-100 for two people), I think it's absurd that they don't accept credit cards. They are CASH or PERSONAL CHECK ONLY. For a place like this - with prices like these - it just comes off as cheap. Secondly, when I called to make a reservation, they encouraged me to bring a bottle of wine (it's BYOB), but did not mention the corkage fees, which will vary depending on the number of people and the number of bottles. It just seemed strange to not mention that additional charge when I called to make the reservation. True 5-star restaurants might work transaction and corkage fees into their menu prices, but I think the quality restaurant culture is beginning to move away from charging separate fees.

Those minor complaints aside, our meal at Cafe Zinho was phenomenal. I wanted something upscale and out-of-the-ordinary for our one night in Pittsburgh. We drove 10 miles from downtown - through sudden blizzard conditions - specifically for this place. Though neither of us are huge seafood aficionados, their menu is very accessible to both adventurous and more reticent eaters. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the puff pastry-encased goat cheese, laid in a sweet pumpkinseed sauce. The entrees really stole the night, however. I ordered the mussels in a vodka tomato sauce laid overtop pappardelle pasta. The sauce included chopped onions and other spices worked right into it, making its consistency chunky rather than ""creamy"" - the word used by the menu description. My fiancé ordered the crab cakes with the lemon-vanilla glaze. Both of us were blown away by these entrees, not to mention obsessed with their Portuguese cornbread that they bring to the table (out of this world). For dessert, the options change - but it appears they usually have a cheesecake and mousse option.  

The staff was helpful, kind, and very invested in their food. The ambiance is very intimate: a small place with a seating capacity of no more than 35, original art lining the walls, and a small bar at the entrance (it's more of a server area because they don't serve alcohol on the premises). Overall, a really memorable evening, only slightly marred by those strange fees, which could be easily avoided.

There are some Portuguese items, but I feel the emphasis is on providing high quality dishes non-specific to any particular cuisine.

For starters, we were brought corn bread which was great. It had a great textural contrast with the flakiness of corn bread along with the fluffiness of loafs.

Next, we had frog legs in a lemon and white wine sauce. The sauce was very pleasant as it highlighted a contrast among bittery, buttery, and sweetness. We dipped many pieces of corn bread in the sauce. Most of the flavor of the frog legs came from the sauce. The frog legs themselves were very chewy. I suspect that they were prepared in an oven; I think quickly grilling or quickly deep frying the frog legs might yield a more pleasant texture.

The main entree was great! I had the filet of trout which comes with grilled vegetables. The grilled veggies were simple yet well executed. The trout was nicely seasoned and cooked. I was able to appreciate the taste of the fish as well as the light seasoning. I wish the trout's skin was a bit crispier; however, I want to emphasis the the fish was cooked very much to my liking.

I made last minute reservations for a Saturday evening because the restaurant we were supposed to go to  closed due to an emergency. Major bummer for us, but life goes on and luckily we were able to get a table at this place. At first we were seated by the register area and that was a little awkward because it felt like the hostess and waitresses were right at the table with us. I wasn't in the mood for a large group dinner so we asked to be moved, a request they graciously accomodated. Unfortunately, we were then seated pretty close to the door and it was a cold February evening so that was a little rough. Fortunately, we had a whole bottle of wine to warm us up.

OK, so now let's talk about the wine thing: 
this is the first BYOB place I've ever eaten at and I loved it! It's pretty great to share a bottle of wine that you can pick out yourself, rather than spend a fortune on some ordinary bottle offered by the restaurant. I didn't know if we had to open the bottle ourselves and brought a cork screw just in case, but turns out they open it for you; I can't remember if there was a corkage fee, but it they do it's a small fee.

Now, for the food: we shared a sardine appetizer and it was quite good. The bread was also really delicious, very fresh and soft. For my entree I ordered the lobster tail and that was very tasty! The veggies served alongside were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light and flavorful.

""Would you care for some dessert?"", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.
This place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.
Finally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.",0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,5,2014-08-02,review,0

The cold prickly pear soup was certainly a good choice of appetizer. The service was acceptable and the staff very welcoming. The only downside to this place is the atmosphere. It can get extremely loud at times (especially when you are sitting next to a party of 12) and it becomes rather difficult to have any table conversation.,0,l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg,0,3,2014-08-28,review,0

The service was smooth and very friendly. The atmosphere was inviting with a small European-style cafe restaurant vibe. Food was fresh and tasty according to all of my friends and was simply amazing from my perspective.  The sardines app and the Portuguese Mariscada seafood stew which I had/shared were cooked perfectly and flavorful. Chef/Owner Toni Pais's back story and his culinary skills are inspirational. He came out to eat afterwards and was very humble when he was given a round of applause.

The proprietor of Zinho is one of the nicest gents in the business as far as I'm concerned.  I know this because I had occasion to collaborate with him on a few events 10 years ago.  So while I may be a bit biased, 10 years in between interactions sort of negates that in my opinion.  My point is, if you're one of those people that enjoys patronizing establishments run by nice people, Zinho fits the bill.  

We arrived last night for my birthday dinner at 7:30 and I immediately fell in love with the place. Nestled along the ""homey"" part of Ellsworth Avenue, Zinho exudes a relaxed luxury that might cater to customers of all types.  Our server Ramon was wonderful, and made thoughtful recommendations for each course.  I selected a roasted beet and goat cheese salad as a starter and crab cakes for my entrée.  Neither disappointed. The salad was a tower of carefully combined goodness and the crab cakes were stuffed, not with filler, but succulent crab.  While I'd get the crab cakes again, next time I'm in for the lamb, since one bite of Jonathan D's dish had me hooked so hard I practically baaa'ed (poor lamb).  At $180 for four people it isn't the cheapest option in the 'Burgh, but by no means is it the most expensive.

For appetizers, we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor, which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. The bread pudding was pretty good though.

Entrees were, on the whole, not impressive. The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare, and the insides were almost fully cooked).

It is complex of museums and  buildings set in several acres of lawns and gardens in Pittsburgh's East End.  It is a wonderful place to bring your out of town guests or just spend by yourself.

You begin your tour with the Helen Frick Art Museum, located on Reynolds Street.  It features  porcelains, bronzes, and rare examples of 17th and 18th-century furniture.  Current exhibits include Steel: Pittsburgh Drawings by Craig McPherson and A Panorama of Pittsburgh: Nineteenth-Century Printed Views. They will  remain on view through June 8, as part of Pittsburgh's 250th anniversary.

Next we have the Car and Carriage Museum.  Henry Clay Frick was apparently quite an auto enthusiast.  His 1914 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost touring car is here as is the first car reportedly registered in Pittsburgh.  My husband Rick likes the 1931 Lincoln.

Then we move on to my favorite, the Greenhouse, the Gardens, and the Lawns.  I believe that admission is free if you just want to stroll around the lawns, which I like to do on a Sunday in May.  In the late 19th Century, greenhouses were very popular with wealthy families.

Finally we come to the house itself, Clayton.  It was purchased for the then princely sum of $22,000 by the Frick's in 1882.  It is done in the Italianate style.  Over 93% of the furnishings in the house are original, and that's what makes it so wonderful.  You get a fair sense of how the Fricks lived--quite a contrast to the steelworkers!  

No stop to the Frick is complete without visiting the cafe.  They believe that good food is an art too and the service here is wonderful.  I took a friend out for her birthday recently.  We had lunch at the cafe, the menu rotates seasonally.  I tried the Shrimp Tostones, which was sauted white shrimp, autumn sprouts, toasted almonds, guava cream, and annatto oil.  In the mood for more ""traditional"" museum fare like hot dogs?  Then try the ""Ultimate Chili Dog"".  Per the website, it is Grilled chicken apple sausage, wild boar chili, grated Gruyere cheese, caramelized onions, and mustard piccalilli on a sourdough roll!

Don't forget to have tea here too.  It is wonderful and the service is impeccable!  You and your guests can easily spend a whole afternoon here!",2,XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q,1,5,2008-04-03,review,4

The Frick Art Museum is not really that interesting or great. There is hardly anything of note. As far as I can see, Helen Frick had way more money than taste and money can't buy you taste. When J.P. Morgan died, he donated his entire art collection to the Met in New York. However the Met did not want everything. Helen Frick bought many pieces that the Met had already passed on, with good reason. Of course not all of the Frick Art collection consists of the Met's castoffs. There many portraits of insignificant nobility done by French court painters who had little talent. Just bec. art is old or expensive, doesn't mean it's really any good. It's a good thing this museum is free.",1,XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q,0,3,2008-05-17,review,4

The house was just incredible. Distinctly Pittsburgh on the outside, but easily one of the best examples of homes from that era on the interior.

Be sure to earmark about 4 hours for the whole experience including, perhaps, a pricey but tasty snack at the cafe (make a reservation).

We arrived at the Frick on a gorgeous blue morning and started out with an excellent tour of the Frick family abode.  When the family moved to New York City after Henry Clay struck it rich in the steel business, they kept their house in Pittsburgh for return visits to the city; 93% of what's in the house is original to the Frick family, which always makes a house tour more interesting to me.  They lived lavishly, and Frick was an avid art collector.  His personal collection -- displayed both in the home and museum -- is impressive.

After our tour we visited the Car and Carriage Museum, which had husband transfixed with its Model T Touring Car, Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, American Bantam Convertible Coupe, Panhard et Levassor Tonneau and Lincoln Model K Sport Phaeton among others.  Finally, we finished up with a spin around the Art Museum itself.  It's a beautiful building with a very manageable size.  I was thrilled to find a current exhibition of Medieval Persian pottery -- found along the ancient Silk Road route -- currently running as well.

My husband and I finally paid a visit to the Frick thanks to the ""We Love Our Members"" promotion that local museums were offering to their members.  (We are members at the Carnegie).  I was vaguely familiar with who Frick was and knew there was a house tour, but I had no idea how much this site had to offer.  

Our visit began with a trip into the shop/visitor's center.  There we browsed the gift shop while waiting for the tour to begin.  The gift shop building was once a playhouse for the children and you can still see where gutters for the bowling alley run through the middle of the floor.  It was a great place to start the tour and begin learning about the family and their connection to the area and American industry.  I am not a Pittsburgh native, so I knew very little about them.  It is important to note that you can't bring large bags with you on the tour, but they do provide free lockers to store them while you are in the house.

The tour continued by entering the house.  The enclosed porch provides a coat rack so you don't have to lug it around with you.  The house is detailed as if the Frick family was still living there.  We learned from our docent that they were fortunate that one of the family members lived there through the 1980s, so the house was well maintained and preserved.  Each room has exquisite detail and decor.  Our guide spent a great deal of time explaining and showcasing the art work.  Many local Pittsburgh artists were featured along with well known artists such as Monet.  Every aspect of the rooms were detailed including showcasing the new development at the time, aluminum.  The rooms upstairs featured less detail but were still interesting.  

After our visit to the house, we stopped in the green house.  I'm not that in to plants, but it was interesting to learn that the plants grown there are used in the cafe.

Speaking of the cafe, we stopped in just to check it out.  They were fully booked that day (which is fine since we weren't planning on eating anyway) but we were so enticed by the dessert selections that we got two desserts to go.  A nutella cheese cake and a baked apple.  We enjoyed those later that evening after dinner.

I am not that in to cars, but the car and carriage museum was very interesting.  The first section is carriages that the Frick family used.  My favorite was their ""special occasion"" carriage that even had  foot warmer!  The car area featured various automobiles that had a connection to Pittsburgh.  There is also the option of watching three short videos about automobiles in Pittsburgh.

The art museum alone is worth a visit.  They were preparing for an exhibit when we were there so only the Italian and French sections were open, but they were fantastic.  A great collection with amazing detail and descriptions of each of the paintings.  The interior of the building is an attraction itself.  It does not look like it was built in the 1960s with the fantastic marble and woodwork.

Even though the music is important (thanks to Meeting of Important People for putting on a great show on Friday night), I think that friends and food really make this event. My husband and I met 8 friends and had a great time chatting and laughing and catching up on life. This is the sort of concert that it's OK to talk through. Then, the food -- you can't forget the food. Our group had fruit and cheese and wine and spring rolls and mac & cheese and dessert and on and on.

The technician has been here 4 times already. Each time there is supposedly something else wrong and so they have to order another part. Miraculously the part is wrong (first week), They forgot to order the second part (2nd week), Part comes in but they need a suppossed other part and it will be ""another 3-5 days""(3rd week), Fourth week rolls by and they ""don't know"" when its coming in (thats up to the distributor). When I ask for an ETA (because I am wearing dirty clothes, and I am sick of technicians coming back 5 times and I already took off a week of work to meet these people) the cus.t service rep gets mad at me and offers me a refund.

the cost of the 5 min fix is $92 bucks! and I have been a customer with this company for while... $92 bucks is cheap...in comparison to their other fixes on that washer... 

being able to wash your clothes at home is a blessing but may break ur bank if you go with this company depending on the malfunction...but everytime they fix it...the problem never re-occurs but something else always manages to break on that washer!

Now what went wrong. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn't what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either. Don't diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.  (And come on, I was WAAAYYYY overdue for a cut since I've been driving to Cleveland for a style.)  That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal. But, when I started to sign the charge slip, it said $65, not $55. ""But,"" I said, ""the website said it was $55 for a Master stylist."" ""Oh,"" the chick at the counter said, ""that's for Men's cuts."" Silly me. 

So when I got back to the office, I went online and checked. Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN's haircut. Hmmmmm. So I called. The chick at the counter now said, ""Oh, our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be."" What?????? So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. ""Oh, well.....I'll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number."" Didn't she have my slip with the card number? ""Sorry, I don't give my credit card number over the phone."" ""Or I can send you a gift certificate."" ""Nope,"" I said through clenched teeth, ""I won't be coming back.""

It wasn't the cut. It was the bait and switch. I'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says, ""Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining."" 

The search goes on. Or I'll be back in Cleveland in the spring for the next cut!

I have to say that Emilio, the owner of Izzazu is the consumate professional when it comes to customer service and follow up.  After my first appointment - at that time to be my last appointment - he doggedly tried to contact me to make the first appointment right.  Emilio and I had quite a lengthly and productive conversation.  He cares very much about making the customer happy AND correcting the situation that was unsatisfactory.  

I did go back and was very pleased with my cut once again.  Because Marshall was running late (20 minutes and counting) Caesar cut my hair this time.  Another great cut!

Again, however, the desk needs training in customer service.  After a 20 minute wait, the receptionist still hadn't notified Marshall that I was there.   A downtown salon depends on clients who are on their lunch hours for the most part.  Next appointment I'll call ahead to see how they're running before heading to the salon and waiting.

2248,JEvkfVPf_DuhX-ntE5L6bQ,U-FTdI6RowaAoZANodeM7Q,"I am a jack of all trades and a do it yourself-er at heart. While in college I worked as a promotional photographer for my very dear friends salon. As a barter service she always did my hair for free! !0 years I had this deal going on. As you can imagine I was pretty spoiled and didn't want to start paying to get my hair did. I began coloring it myself. Now as a licensed skin care specialist you pick things up from the cosmetologists working with you.

I killed it, fried it and melted it. My hair was in dire straights! I have dark hair but I love being a red head. Marcia Cross red to be exact. Whoops! Lightening that many levels should not ever be done by a novice. What can I say?  I'm stubborn that way, and think I can do it all! 

I reached out to Emilio for help! I have to say that after many hours of laying down color he managed to make my hair healthy again and I left feeling like a movie star. A red headed movie star! I was flipping my hair all the way to the parking garage and even did a photo-shoot later that evening. Yes I did a photo-shoot because I needed a professional head shot for my work portfolio.


I don't know if I'm being too harsh but my hair did turn out much darker than I had wanted it to be. I know sometimes it is hard to predict the outcome when mixing chemistries. 

The other problem I had was the price tag, or the surprise when I went to pay. $250.00 for a color correction! I know this is normal sometimes when fixing the damage but it is also crucial to give your client some kind of idea on payment. I had gone in for color estimated at around $70. I think they did a decent job but for that money It should have been closer to what I asked for.

I was extremely please with the low-lights I requested as well as the hair cut and style. Let alone, the numerous compliments I received from others about my cut, color, and style.

I was admittedly skeptical of buying the Groupon I used yesterday [$65.00 off salon services], given the location that was closest to me was downtown. The address Yelp has listed is their old address. They are now located at 301 5th Ave and have been since October of 2010. My apprehension was due to the downtown location. Not so much parking per se, but loathing a pretentious salon atmosphere. Pittsburgh salons never seem to lack pretension and not surprisingly if you have read my other reviews pretension is something I could not abhor more. Nevertheless, the reception staff and my stylist were very courteous and service oriented. Thankfully, hoity-toity is not a word I could use to describe either of them.

As I have never been to an Izzazu salon before, nor have I asked my friends if they have either, I did not know which stylist to request. When I made my appointment I asked the woman, ""who would YOU want to color and cut YOUR hair?"" I was told Frank is an excellent stylist and had availability for the time I requested. 

Frank was knowledgeable, personable, and kind. He was meticulous and diligent about the low-light placements as well as making sure I have the proper amount of them. Too often, especially when using Groupons stylists hurry through placement and provide them sparsely. But this stylist did not forget the point of businesses choosing to provide Groupons. Provide excellent service, and those new customers will return! 

I've read one or two other reviews that commented on dirty bowls and a lack of sanitation. Perhaps I am not retentive enough to write a thorough review. I am not here to nit-pick businesses. Not to say that I did notice my color bowl, it resembled a normal color bowl not dirty or offensive by any means. Perhaps in the past they possessed such bowls and learned the errors of their ways. Or perhaps some people can never be pleased. All I can say, I was not worried about any sanitation concerns.

Every time I see this type of privately run ice cream shop it reminds me of home and lazy summer days with my girlfriends. Riding bikes to the local pool, playing at the beach on lakeside, or causing a ruckus at the Whippy Dip! Oh, sooo serious summer romances... flirting with boys while throwing ice from our slushies was a regular occurrence.

Finally, a warm spring day on the books and the only place I want to go is The Page. The location is so weird! Under this huge bridge away from any greenery or picnic tables next to a low end used car dealer. I suggest grabbing your food and heading elsewhere. There is always some sort of line and it gets worse on the weekend. These guys and gals are pros when it comes to ice cream and will recite all the flavors with speed that you might miss them. It's kind of like the Cheese steak place in Philly. Know your order when you get to the counter, pay, and move OVER!

The only bad thing is that it's too close to where we live, so I can expect my sugar intake to go through the roof now.

As you walk up, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the signage and menu, as they seem to have everything that you could ever imagine. In fact, you might just be better off walking up and ordering whatever you want without looking at the menu. Odds are, they'll just smile and run off to make it. I mean, if they have toasted coconut soft serve ice cream, what don't they have, right?

The people that work there are all really pleasant and the ice cream is excellent! It is cash only, so that might be a downside if you're just randomly stopping by for the first time, but it's one place where the long lines are truly warranted in this town. Don't worry, though, usually the line isn't actually long at all. They take your order quickly at Page and your order will actually be up impressively fast for the amount of people ordering thanks to Page Dairy Mart's army of ice cream servers on staff. That ""line"" of people will disappear as quickly as a new one appears.

Hubby had a cone of regular soft serve ice cream and said it was really yummy.  He also had an order of cheese sticks and said they were just o.k., so we will probably stick to ice cream/frozen yogurt from this place.

You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.

The possibilities are endless, seriously. My bf has had their chocolate chip sundae & the brownie sundae. Their cookies and brownies are both amazing and soft and tasty. They have food also, which I haven't had the opportunity to try at this point but I have heard good things. The prices are more than reasonable.

There is usually a line to wait in, no matter what the weather is, because everyone wants a piece of Page's! The only small, teeny tiny issue I have is the location, while there is much history behind it (Refer to windows for newspaper articles), it is dangerous to pull in and out of on the corner of Carson and Becks Run. I got in a horrible accident by someone who hit me coming out of Fagel Street, which is right behind the dairy mart, so just be careful pulling in and out of Page's.

I've known Jonathan (chef/owner) for a few years and he's done some good improvements.  He's added a bar upstairs which is very cool and they also have a patio that's great.  I had a dinner party there in the summer and have another one planned in March and Jonathan totally goes the extra effort to make it special.  He arranged for a dj last time, so we were able to dance off some of his food.  Okay, the food is great.  I especially recommend the Veal Chop.  The staff is awesome. I really like Marney and Errol (two main servers) and I like Jordan the bartender upstairs (Marney's daughter).  I'd like to give this place 5 stars, but it has a few smaller problems.  It's a little bit pricey.  The good is that the cost does include salad, pasta, and bread, but the bad is that you'll easily spend $50 on an entree.  The Veal Chop is $65.  That's a little much, especially considering the location.  The dishes also which are delicious are simply toooooo big.  I mean literally you can three meals out of one entree,  I would suggest some smaller plates especially for the bar.  One last tip, even though it's not BYOB anymore, you can still BYOB.  He won't turn you away.  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The chef is really talented and I'd hazard a guess that if he was in New York he could be a celebrity chef if he wanted.

The mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent.

I started out with the twelve ounce stuffed meatball and the truffled mushroom appetizers. The waiter invited me to watch as the mushrooms were being prepared at the kitchen counter. There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he sauté them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite.

2328,BbfGr5eTdW-I-9KI5KN0ag,eT1LP7q0vz5F8ffPBqPtGw,"Some people train for marathons, other people train for this meal. Before sitting down make sure you get in the proper state of mind and prepare yourself for a long night of indulgence. This being my first dining experience at Alla Famiglia, I was unaware of the challenge that I had undertaken. We had A Party of Five, empty bellies and an optimistic mentality; we couldn't resist the tempting appetizers recited to us and ended up ordering the mega meatball, calamari and shrimp, and sausage over polenta. All were amazing. The meatball was the highlight: twelve ounces of perfectly cooked beef, filled with mozzarella and covered in sauce and provolone (kisses fingers). Big plus for including the tentacles in the calamari. I've noticed these legs less and less while dining out, when did they lose suction as a staple of a calamari appetizer? Also adorning our table were a few clothing options in which to dress the bread, all of them enjoyable on their own or as an ensemble.

One would think after such a hearty opener all that remained was the main course. How wrong of an assumption that turned out to be. Before we could even think about crushing our dinners, we had to face two formidable courses of salad and pasta. As mentioned by other reviewers, the salad is great. Nice dressing, nice fillers, nice roughage. The pasta that's included with the entree was a fusilli bucati in a vodka sauce served family style. Unable to pass up the promise of a great carbonara with guanciale and fresh egg, we had two pasta opponents to tackle. Both were cooked so perfectly al dente I would have put them on my NHL all-star ballot as a write-in if voting hadn't already closed.

At this point in the meal, I had completely forgotten that I still hadn't even seen my main course. And I was fine with that. As a table we compiled quite the culinary collection: bistecca fiorentina, veal milanese, veal marsala, mussels in a diavola sauce and the sea bass special for the evening. You know when a meal is so utterly divine that you just stop talking to everyone around you and have a one on one pow wow with the gastro-gods? Yeah, that's what happened. I will say at one point during the meal, my brother had to get up and take a walk around the restaurant for fear he would wake up two days later in the ICU if he didn't fight off the impending food coma that threatened his existence. Instead of napkins they should have given us a white towel and a trainer to throw it on the table for us because we were doing our best impression of Apollo Creed...and our food was Ivan Drago.

Our waiter, who we thought was our friend, then had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert, some balls on that guy. Of course we wanted dessert. We decided on the tiramisu which I hope had a clean bill of health because it blew our minds. It was so good that I was upset with myself. I did exactly what I hate seeing someone do on any and every food network show. I took a bite, put down my fork, closed my eyes and just said, ""wow!"" I just hope it was as good for the tiramisu.

Other housekeeping items: you can bring your own wine for which they charge a corking fee. All the water is bottled, but I didn't see it on the bill so I figure it's included. The chef/owner is extremely friendly and accessible, as he is cooking basically right next to your table. Parking at the meters next to the building is free after 6pm, despite what it says on the signs; our waiter informed us they have an unspoken agreement with the parking authority.

They take everything in stride. Things start with fresh bread, a small dish of olives and the Holy oil....better love garlic!

Appetizer....a tasty softball-sized meatball with mozzarella in a nicely spiced red sauce. Not your average hamburger meatball...this is a work of art...perfectly seasoned, juicy and delicious.

Salad....wow! Crisp greens, olives, peppers, Gorgonzola with a red wine based vinaigrette...couldn't stop eating it.

Pasta course....opted for both house pastas....the first was the oft mentioned linguine tossed in the wheel of Romano with cream and black pepper. Served table side with a bottle of deliciously spicy oil. Second was the curly pasta tossed in the signature vodka sauce! The pasta was spot on cooked...not a soggy noodle in sight. The preparations were executed to perfection.

Entrees...veal Milanese...this is a beautiful double chop, ""paddled"" into tenderness, dredged in house made bread crumbs, tossed with pine nuts and cooked to perfection. If you can only order one thing here...this is it! We also had the filet of beef in Gorgonzola cream...medium rare, tender, well seasoned...rich, decadent and incredible.

Dessert....yes...we forced ourselves...homemade cannoli and a variant of tiramisu with toasted/burnt almond slivers and raspberries. Tiramisu was delectable...light, balanced and very flavorful.

Haven't really added much to the raves from previous patrons...just had to chime in our hearty AMEN of agreement. Love everything about this place. Thank you Jonathan...and all of your staff for an awesome dining experience.",2,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,1,5,2012-09-11,review,3
2339,nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ,T2vaDjAoka8tTEfiZdlopA,"FACT: Thee best Italian meal I've had in the Burgh, hands down!
FACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher.
FACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.

Need some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with ""Holy Oil,"" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! 

We ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. 

We also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!

For the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!

Fourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.

For the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.

Whenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. 

A perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!",5,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,5,5,2012-09-25,review,15

Chef Jonathan is a genius - his ""Veal Chop Milanese"" with lump crab, toasted pine nuts, and lemon is the BEST I've ever had.  Every time we eat here, my husband orders this dish and refuses to try anything else - that's how AMAZING it is.  

I have tried a variety of entrees - everything from the the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo to the Steak il pizzaiolo to the Medallions of veal Pomodoro ai Pepperoni.  Each dish is infused with deliciousness that makes these entrees OUT OF THIS WORLD!  

You have got to try the following:  mozzarella (apptz), hot peppers (apptz), mozzarella stuffed meatball (apptz), vodka pasta (automatically received with your meal - sauce is delicious), veal chop milanese (entrée).  

You won't be disappointed - the kitchen is open so you can even watch as Chef Jonathan prepares your dinner.  

Make a reservation.  Neighborhood is a bit sketchy so be careful.  

PS.  I've taken all my friends, family, and business partners (many who do not live in Pittsburgh) here and everyone absolutely loves it and wishes they lived in Pitt so they could come here more often.  In fact, we no longer live in Pittsburgh, but every time we come into town for a visit, we HAVE to eat dinner at our favorite Alla Famiglia!",1,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,1,5,2012-11-07,review,2

Could not have asked for more than what we got tonight at Alla Famiglia.  Service was very good, helpful and friendly.  The right balance of being there without dominating the table.

Food was top notch.  My only complaint would be that there was too much of it !  

The Lamb Chops were fantastic. Our kids shared a serve and they had to fight us off.  I had the House Specialty, "" Veal Chop Milanese""  and was very impressed.

Hard to fault any of the food actually.  From the bread and Holy Oil that starts the meal, through the appetizers, the salad and the pasta, on to the mains.  Everything was stunning.

If there's a special occasion to celebrate, it's done here, no questions asked. Everything on the menu is phenomenal, and the service is phenomenal as well. The restaurant itself is very intimate and cozy and there is valet available, so the fact that it's in a sketchy neighborhood matters not. The bar upstairs is nice, but dining downstairs is something else, as you can watch your food being prepared. Make sure you visit on an empty stomach, as you will be served multiple courses! The vodka pasta you are given is AMAZING. You also get salad and bread with two dips/oil. Entrees are well-sized and you'll probably have the leftovers ever after gorging on all of the mini meals that come before the entree. I do not eat beef... until i go to alla famiglia and order the meatball appetizer. That's saying something, so don't forget to order it. My mum gets some hunk of beef (sorry, I don't even really look at beef/pork options) every time we go and I can hear her making moaning noises as she chews, and then she talks about how to die for it was afterward. I usually get a seafood dish, whatever it may be at the time, and it is always one of the greatest things I have and will ever eat. I want my final meal to be from Alla Famiglia. Please.

Well, lucky for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said, ""Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it.""  YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!

So on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.

First off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.

The Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.

Onto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy.

Salad course: Great salad!

Pasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...

For the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.

I could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. 

I really cannot wait to go again.",3,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,2,5,2013-02-13,review,5
2344,prt4Pvu69WGv5pc87RuLMQ,53yNXQJNCBsBc9-RiSEDdg,"Incredible experience up here, I would have to say that this goes down as one of my most memorable dining experiences in Pittsburgh for a number of reasons. I personally love this style of Italian cooking. Sicilian, so folks who are not familiar should take look at their menu online before coming because it might catch you off guard, it isn't what the ""normal"" Italian restaurant offers. 

I had a great experience dodging potholes on my way through the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh which it makes it much more awarding arriving with my wheels of my vehicle still in alignment. They have valet parking which is great because it takes the stress out of trying to find parking.

Upon entering I almost fainted at the smells and views of this place. Right when I walked in I saw an array of freshly prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was beautiful and really made realize right then what kind of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were promptly seated and received an explanation of everything that was on the table for our enjoyment. The ""Holy Oil"" was ridiculous and almost addicting I couldn't stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite.  Folks when you come here don't eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. 

Then be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner.

I then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review.

I did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork.

I wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know!",4,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,3,5,2013-03-16,review,4

Some of the best Italian food I have had in my life. Everything feels authentic, straight from Italy, and family owned. 

Where to begin? Well the appetizer selection is incredible, my favorite being the provolone fried in truffle oil. The stuffed banana peppers were to die for, and I have had many others that were spectacular.

For the entree, I have had both the veal chop and the filet. The veal chop is almost as large as my arm (not joking) and was delicious, prepared either of their two signature ways. For the filet, I do not like gorgonzola so I asked them to prepare it a different way (which they are very willing to do and usually announce to the table at the beginning of the meal). It was done is a mushroom sauce that was a perfect compliment to the perfectly cooked filet.

Finally, do not forget to save room for dessert (which will be fairly difficult considering the sheer volume of food that they give you). The tiramisu is amazing, and I would highly recommend trying their gelato. 

In short, my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I would highly recommend a visit, especially with a large group. Reservations help, but not usually required.",1,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,5,2013-06-18,review,1

My wife and I dined at Alla Famiglia last night, and we were both blown away.  It was our first time here so we went with our waiter's suggestions from start to finish.


After snacking on the ridiculously delicious 'Holy Oil', we started with a couple apps -  Greens and Beans, and the Meatball; both were incredible.  Braised endive, house sausage, and tender white beans seasoned to perfection, and a meatball the size of your fist.

Before our entrees were brought out, we were each brought a salad and pasta course.  The fresh made pasta was served with the best vodka sauce I have ever had -   amazing.

On to the entrees;  I got the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo and my wife got the Coteletta Del Monzu.  Spectacular.   Both the veal chop and the cutlet melted in our mouths.

All in all, after a couple apps, two entrees, a bottle of wine and a couple cocktails, we got out for about $260 after tip.  That said, I've eaten at some amazing restaurants in my time, and I can say with confidence that last night's dinner is easily one of the top 5 meals I've had in my lifetime.  I can't wait to find an excuse to go back.

Well done, Alla Famiglia.


Update:  Visits 2 and 3 to Alla Famiglia were just as spectacular as the first.  My wife and I have ordered something different each time we've visited, and normally I'd say something like 'we haven't been disappointed'.  However, that would be an egregious understatement.  Every visit to this wonderful restaurant has been nothing short of  astonishing.  The food is truly breathtaking, and the service is top notch.

In my humble opinion, this is without question the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.

While it was a bit of a drive from Cranberry Township, we needed a dining reprieve after a disappointing visit at BRAVO! Cucina Italiana.

Upon entering, we were warmly welcomed by the host.  We visited on a stormy evening and were fortunate to find that some reservations had been cancelled due to the weather, which enabled us to get a table.  I strongly advise to get reservations in advance.  We were seated on the first floor with a view of the chefs cooking.  Awesome.
All that has been said in prior reviews, I heartily agree with.  The bread, cheese, and dipping oil was a delicious start.  Ingredients were fresh.

This is the framed ""art"" inside the women's restroom located on the 2nd floor. Odd. I nearly poked my eyes out with my mascara brush from staring. It's hypnotizing.

Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about  the restaurant!

After months of whining, a group of 8 of us finally decided to nut up or shut up and finally made plans. (Thank you, Samantha B. for organizing!)

Getting a reservation for 8 is not an easy task. The building is a three-story, traditional townhouse  that is very narrow leaving only so much space inside for the dining area, bar, and the kitchen. And, it is located in the middle of Allentown. Yes, Allentown. This fact could qualify as the baby elephant in the room but it seems to be the trend to operate fantastic restaurants in areas that would make your average xenophobe from suburbia go bat shit cray cray.  And, for the record, I'm not drinking Hatorade. I was equally ""scurred""  during the drive up E. Warrington Avenue...and I live in the East End where hipsters and old school hippies are known to reside and give peace a chance. 

The reality is what it is. It's a scary part of town but it did not matter a damn when we got out of the car. It was a Saturday night and we were greeted by an average Joe  valet who sincerely welcomed us to the restaurant  and told us to enjoy our dinner. The locals who walked by smiled and nodded as if they were giving us their approval. It's as if the restaurant was under a dome, protected by a force field that doesn't allow the stereotypical nonsense most would fear when entering Allentown at night. 

We were greeted by our server who immediately took our drink orders. I didn't see a bar on the first floor so I almost hesitated to order my usual dirty martini and my sweetheart's Manhattan, thinking they were limited in their mixology. Orders were taken without pause and both drinks were most impressive. Our friends enjoyed vino rossos and biancos from their diverse wine list that is 100% Italia! 

Tables are set with ""Holy Oil"" for dipping artisanal Italian breads, a seasoned cheese and cecci bean gustoso, and, my favorite, a fresh goat cheese olive spread.

We started with the artichoke appetizer special and shared the meatball appetizer with the rest of the table. Yes, shared. The meatball is bigger than Barry Bonds and Kanye West's egos combined. And, it was friggin' fantastic. The flavors, the marinara sauce, the mozzarella stuffed inside...If I could marry a meatball, this would be matrimonial bliss.

My sweetheart chose the highly recommended veal chop Milanese. This is yet another piece of meat listed on the menu not small in size. Because I am always the a-hole of the group, I asked if I could have Linguine and Clam sauce instead of the pasta prep on the menu. Again, no hesitation. Wow. But the groans from my our table makes me still an a-hole. I DON'T CARE! IT WAS MY CARB DAY DAMNIT! :-)

Our entrees did not disappoint. TASTY!!!! The entrees minus the pasta came with salad and pasta side served family style. Lots of food to be shared.

We finished with the hand-spun espresso gelato. Others at the table went for other gelato flavors and the Tiramisu. We all had spoons to share. All were ""delish"".

I was tempted to order the other highly recommended entree, the Cowboy Steak Diane. My friend Beth had the pleasure. The wild mushrooms on her dish looked just as big as the meatballs and she raved about the Worcestershire butter. She offered me a sample but I was too full and ready to birth my food baby.

Oh yeah. How could I forget! Franco Harris walked in. SHUT UP!!! Not entirely surprising after viewing the wall on the second floor covered with photos of VIPs posing with the chef/owner. 

It's great to see a gem in Allentown that can shine a light on the other diamonds in the ruff in that area. But don't let  the neighborhood fool you. This restaurant is VERY high end in service, cuisine, price, and atmosphere.

2359,kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA,GCb2T50KWDE0_xnXjQwzhA,"I stopped by here this past Thursday with my fiance and 4 other dining companions for dinner.  Alla Famiglia has been on my list of places to try for quite a long time and I was eagerly anticipating eating a dinner here.  We arrived shortly before our reservation time of 7:30 at about the same time as another couple from our party. We were almost immediately taken back to our table which was on the first floor in a back room.  I honestly didn't notice too much while we were walking back to our table but thought there was not much decoration in the room we were in.  Yes there was a fireplace but nothing else really sticks out besides the fact that the lights would dim a bit for about 5 seconds before eventually brightening back up every 10 minutes or so.

Since none of our party had ever been to Alla Famiglia before our server took the time to go over the menu with us.  Whenever he got to the veal chop and explained it was their specialty, I immediately knew that was what I wanted.  So I ended up ordering that with the pizzaiolo option while my fiance went with the seafood diavolo.  My veal chop was described as a double cut natural chop braised with hot and sweet peppers, homemade Italian sausage, and plum tomatoes while my fiances seafood diavola had many different types of seafood in it including a lobster tail.  All entrees also come with a first course of salad and a second course of pasta with vodka sauce, both served family style.  While we were waiting for our first course to come out they served us some crusty Italian bread along with a couple of different dipping sauces of which I remember one that had a couple of different imported cheeses, one with goat cheese and then another which was olive oil based and called the holy oil(?) due to a trio of herbs of which one was basil.  That one was my favorite and when combined with some of the Parmesan cheese that they had on the table was awesome.  After a short while our salads came out, 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us along with a dish of Gorgonzola so that we could top our salads with it.  The salad ended up tasting decent, I only wish that I had more of it.  The six of us quickly finished it all and then were in for quite a bit of a wait before our pasta with vodka sauce arrived.  It was long enough for all of us to notice and wonder what was taking so long for pasta.  Whenever it arrived, once again 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us, I thought that it tasted pretty good.  It wasn't the best vodka sauce I have ever tasted but since I was still pretty hungry at this point I really enjoyed it especially after adding some of the chili oil that they brought to the table with it.  The chili oil gave the sauce that perfect bite for me.  Almost immediately after finishing our pasta our dinner entrees arrived.  My veal chop looked impressive and was big enough to make comments about how it could tip the car on the Flintstones.  Most of that was due to the size of the bone although there was a decent amount of meat on it.  The veal itself was cooked perfectly as it was moist and juicy and I  ended up enjoying it. The pizzaiolo sauce was just ok though as some of the sausage that I had seemed to be burnt while others were fine.  Whenever I had the non burnt pieces I liked it but the couple of burnt pieces really made the sauce inconsistent from bite to bite.  I was also lucky enough to try some of my wonderful fiances lobster tail and thought that it was very good.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender and tasty while not being overdone at all.  After all that we had eaten our whole table ended up passing on dessert and I left the restaurant full but not overly so.  I am still wondering about all of these reviews that tell you how much food they received which was also said by the valet on the way in.  It made me wonder do they normally serve a family style portion to two people instead of the three like they did at our table?  Should I feel cheated on this one?  Maybe I will find out on a future visit but then again maybe I will not.

The bottom line for me is that I might come back here again in the future but I don't think that this would be my first choice.  Don't get me wrong, the food here was pretty good but whenever my food bill after tip is coming out to about $150, they had better either have impeccable service like the Capital Grille or Ruth Chris' or to die for food.  Sadly Alla Famiglia let me down on both accounts here as the food was good and the service average.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,4,2013-10-02,review,2
2360,f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA,DccaQ26Y6UR4FGwWGKPSLA,"After hearing about AF and reading the reviews, I was expecting an amazing experience. We made reservations weeks in advance and I counted down the days. Finally, D day arrived. We arrived and quickly valeted the car. I would definitely suggest you valet. The neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. Into the restaurant I happily galloped. What a cute little place. Open kitchen in the first room. We sat in the second room. Homey, old school Italian feel. The server explained the menu and took our drink order. Hubs and I split a bottle of wine. Nothing better than a good bottle of red wine with a hearty Italian meal. 

We were ready to eat. I dug into the bread on the table and thoroughly enjoyed the holy oil dip. So much so that I didn't even bother with the other two spreads. The menu was very veal heavy. I guess that's their specialty but not what I was looking for. I chose the filet gorgonzola. Our first course was salad. Served family style this salad was savory and sweet with raisins and gorgonzola on the side. Then we waited, and waited and waited. They are definitely not in a rush here. The next course was pasta with vodka sauce. After reading the reviews, I was a little disappointed that we were not offered the alfredo cheese wheel as an option. The vodka sauce was lacking flavor for me. I added a little chili oil and it brightened up some. Again we waited and waited. Finally, our entrees arrived. My filet was cooked well and tender. However, I did not care for the peppers and creamy sauce it was topped with. Also, this was the only part of the meal that I had left overs to take home. For me, the portion sizes were about average. I did not have mounds of left overs as other reviews noted. We opted to skip dessert. Overall, it was a good meal but nothing blew me away. I had high hopes for AF and was slightly let down.

The Meatball was excellent. Note I said Meatball, as this is one ball bigger than your fist. Stuffed with cheese, served in an amazing tomato sauce and topped with fresh parmesan. And this was just the appetizer

Next up was the Veal scallopini Tarfuto, which is served with onions. But before that arrived, first comes an amazing walnut vinagrette salad then a fresh pasta in vodka sauce. Both to die for. Picture the pain I am in before I even get to the veal.

This is a restaurant to celebrate an occasion at such as New Years, Valentines Day, Anniversaries,etc. 
my girlfriend and I came here for New Year's Eve and we could not have enjoyed it more. To start we had the Alla Famiglia Meatball. I couldn't get over the rich tomato sauce that the meatball was surrounded in and the smoothness of the actual meat. Just delicious, must have.
When you order an entree you also get their house salad served in a homemade Italian vinaigrette (light and complimenting to the diverse salad topped with great peppers!) and their Penne Alla Vodka. This pasta dish alone is enough to warrant a visit . I am a alla vodka lover and this is the best I've ever had. It's hard to describe but its not to rich or creamy it's absolutely just right. The pasta itself was so smooth and melted in your mouth with their sauce.

For entree my girlfriend had their Ahi Tuna Steak (special). Prepared perfectly and with a great lemon butter sauce. I had their speciality, their double cut Veal Chop. This is something straight out of The Flintstones in its portion but let me tell you it's with every penny. I had the Veal Chop Pizzoaloa style wivh was with hot & sweet peppers, a great tomato sauce covered in provolone cheese. This was such a moist Veal Chop that literally fell off the bone and with the marbling it just melted in your mouth.

We don't go out & splurge like this often, so we were really excited for a special dinner. The food was out of this world (bread & sides, salad, pasta alla vodka and veal chop Milanese), but the service was absolute garbage. I've seriously been treated better at a TGIFriday's. We waited, pretty much unattended to, at the bar until 8:20 for an 8:00 reservation. Once seated, I practically had to beg for a wine list. We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company. As my boyfriend was talking with the cab company, a waitress walked by. We heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff, ""UGH, those people at the bar are JUST now ordering a cab."" It was 10:30. On a Saturday night.

I don't know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s), but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time. Maybe if we were in our 50s like everyone else, they would've treated us like adults.

The vodka sauce pasta starter that comes with it is wonderful in and of itself, and the salad, the salad is spectacular! That's the thing about this place, not a single aspect of the meal disappoints or falls short of amazing. I did not order an appetizer as I had to send some of the pasta back as well as some of the veal because I just couldn't eat it all - this will feel like a sin, but what can you do. I am sure the appetizers are amazing as well. Lets not forget the martini that I would say is about the best you're going to find in ""the Burgh""!

I have never eaten there before last night, but I have eaten at Davio's and that is what the atmosphere reminded me of.. we were there a total of 3 hours start to finish.. 3 hours until our main course was served. But, many courses are served as you wait... most of them were delicious. They bring you out fresh, delicious, warmed bread at the beginning with a garlic oil sauce dubbed ""holy oil"" and it truly is heavenly. They also have a bowl of cheese and garbanzo beans to eat atop of the bread. Delicious. There is also a cheesy spread available. All were wonderful. Then about 45 minutes later, they brought our appetizer. It was a soupy-looking mushroom appetizer with a sweet flavor. I do not recommend this app. It wasn't good. Then about 35 minutes after that, a salad was served. It came dressed and was one of the best I've had. 35-45 minutes after that, the HIGHLIGHT of the dinner came. Pasta in a bowl. It was the best part of the dinner. Finally another long time after that - our main course came. Mine looked only slightly better than it tasted. I got the seafood diavolo and it was a huge disappointment.
 I really liked our waiter - he was very busy but attentive - but I cursed him under my breath for recommending this main course. I was so close to ordering a pasta dish, which I'm certain I would have loved and devoured. But I was talked out of ordering pasta, because pasta comes with dinner. I wish our waiter would have asked me what I liked; sauces, etc before recommending this dish. $68 for something you give to your cat is a hard pill to swallow. I love seafood, but I enjoy it in butter sauces, lemony butter sauces, Alfredo sauces, wince sauces with garlic... not this red soupy dish.
 It was literally like eating cold tomatoes and water with Tabasco sauce poured in. It looked like ""seafood soup."" All the delicious seafood was drowning in a dark red, spicy, soupy mess. I wanted to cry when I saw it.. then I tasted it and really wanted to cry. It was gross. This is the last dish I would have ever ordered had I known how it was presented. I looked around at my date who had a massive veal tenderloin in front of him and I was so jealous.. wishing I had went with my first instinct - the pasta - or even the Halibut.. anything that wasn't drowning in a spicy red soup. I just hope that staff read this and never recommend this dish to a first-timer.. especially someone who enjoys seafood they can actually TASTE that isn't drowning in some spicy tomato sauce. If this dish wasnt so awful, I would have given 5 stars. The only other bad dish was the mushroom appetizer, and it was also a soupy mess. but, i would eat the mushroom app 3 times a day for the rest of my life if it came down to that and the seafood diavolo.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,3,2014-08-15,review,0
2376,In4m9--fwTjb--EnhQRz2g,tXC3cjjFcCghobeLkO3SwQ,"UPDATED: Just wanted to share that we attempted to visit for a third time when my husband's brother was in town in mid-November of 2014.  We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, ""no, it's not ready yet.""  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a ""can we get you a drink on the house?"" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us ""that's for a reservation."" ""Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.""  ""They must have specifically requested that table.""  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.

My husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  

While my husband enjoys many of the more ""up and coming"" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.

Let's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...

I've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. 

The second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.

Finally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.",0,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,5,2014-08-15,review,0

My husband took me here for my birthday celebration.  We were treated extremely well from the second we walked in the door.  They even had a menu printed with a ""Happy birthday Jennifer"" message on the top!  What a nice touch.

We were seated in the area near the door with a view of the kitchen.  There is also a small room (three tables) on the same floor.  The upper floor has a dining area and bar, but they are often booked for private events.

When you arrive, there are three accompaniments for your fresh baked bread.  The ""holy oil"" that is an olive oil and banana pepper mix.  It lives up to its name because it was divine.  There was also a goat cheese spread that had red peppers and olives.  I'm a huge goat cheese fan, so I could have eaten this by the spoonful.  There was also a bean and cheese mixture with three types of cheese chopped up.  It was incredible as well.  You may be tempted to fill up on these delictible delights, but don't, becase as good as these items are, it only gets better from there.

We were having a hard time deciding whether to get the meatball appetizer or the hand pulled mozzarella.  The waitress steered us towards their meatball since it is one of their signature items.  It was a wise decision.  The meatball is the size of a fist and it was perfect.  I don't usually like meatballs or red sauce and I found myself devouring every last bit of both on this plate.  The meatball is stuffed and topped with an excellent mozzarella and then drenched with an amazing red sauce with bits of garlic.  If you order this, make sure you are sharing because it is huge. 

The salad course was very tasty.  It as a mix of field greens, an olive oil dressing, gorgonzola and other incredibly tasty things.  I could have eaten the entire plate of it myself but wanted to save room for the pasta and my entree.

The pasta course is a house made spiral pasta in a vodka sauce.  It was extremely tasty.  So much so that my husband said he would have been happy if that alone had been his main course.  It had such incredible fresh taste.  

For our main courses, I got the veal chop prepared in the milanese style.  It was HUGE, pretty much the size of the plate.  A nice surprise considering how small portions tend to be at other fancy restaurants in the area.  It was served with a lemon butter sauce and had large chunks of crab on top.  It was tender and you could cut it with a fork.  I savored every bite (and have leftovers to enjoy at home).  My husband had the filet and loved his choice as well.  A lot of flavors and extremely tender.  It was served with a leek cream and I would love to know how they make it because I have leeks at home that I need to use for something.

I swore I didn't have room left for even a single bite more, but when I learned that pumpkin gelato was the dessert, I had to try it.  It was so smooth, sweet and reminded me of the amazing gelato I had when I was in Italy.  A house made limoncello completed my incredibly amazing meal.

Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth it!  I don't know when we'll be back simply because of how expensive it is, but I do know we'll be back.",3,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,0,5,2014-10-30,review,4

2382,FyCBkNXwoI_6X6apbslg4g,VybmGjKYJEUJi8CE3OwTbA,"My husband made us reservations here to celebrate our 5th anniversary and I am confident in saying that it was the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy and not stuffy at all, which is not often the case with ""fine dining.""  I appreciated the home-like feeling and the framed Pens jerseys on the wall! I am becoming a Yinzer...

The bread and holy oil, chickpea dish, and goat cheese spread that they set the table with was amazingly good, and it only gets better.  All their meals come with a salad and a pasta dish with vodka sauce.  (I didn't see anything about fettucine in a cheese wheel, so maybe they don't do that anymore--not sure.)

I ordered seafood diavolo but could only finish about 1/3 of it, and my husband ordered a steak dish that he (amazingly) polished off.  He said it was the best steak he's had since we left Nebraska, so that's a pretty high compliment.

Yes, this place is expensive ($50-ish/entree), but you can DEFINITELY get at least two meals from one, and there is an option to share a dinner with a $15 charge for the extra pasta and salad dish, which may be the route I would take in the future since I'm a snacker and would rather have an appetizer as dinner anyway.

I think everyone in the 'burgh should try this place at least once, for a special occasion dinner because it's awesome!",7,qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g,2,5,2014-11-17,review,5
2383,hru2IDwSyN61sgWPtJw_hA,utF_7QHQD-WKeXnAW-9wJA,"I had been wanting to come here for a very long time.  I finally ate here this past Saturday and it was awesome.  Now I can't wait to come back!

First, I urge you to make a reservation because every single table was filled while we were there, and for good reason--the food is AWESOME.  The food is so good you aren't even going to feel guilty about the calories you have consumed--because you will eat A LOT OF THEM.

The second thing you need to know is to show up HUNGRY.  Don't eat all day.  If possible, do what I did and work out earlier in the day, because you will leave this restaurant WELL FED.  To quote one of the great artists of our time, Ice Cube, ""Life ain't a track meet, its a marathon!""

It is a marathon.  They're going to bring you out delicious warm bread as soon as you sit down, and supply you with heavenly toppings for it, including the famous Holy Oil that is truly divine.  Temperance is a virtue.  Don't be like me and commit a sin against your entree by eating it when you are STUFFED, and can't fully enjoy it. because like a fool you couldn't restrain yourself with the bread bc carbs turn you into AN ANIMAL and you didn't pace yourself.

You'll get all the bread you can handle.  Our waiter John, who was super nice and attentive, suggested we order the meatball appetizer and he was right.  Its huge, its literally the size of a softball and comes out wrapped in cheese, in a heavenly marinara sauce, served with love.  It was extremely good.  

Then you get the salad course, which comes in a home made vinagrette which is also delicious.  

Then comes the pasta course,  We had fusilli pasta in vodka sauce which was very good but at this point I was basically full and tapping out.  I ended up eating not even 1/4 of my pasta, but then the waiter offered to bag it up for me, so I had lunch for the next day.

Your entree comes out after the pasta course, and you're going to be already stuffed at this point.

 Now, I took my friend here for his birthday.  I think they key is to come here when you are not paying, bc my bank account was crying when I saw the entrees start at $40.  More on that in a moment.

I ordered the filet and it was SPECTACULAR.  I mean, amazing.  So good I did not share, and after I ate it, I fondly reflected on the time my filet and I spent together.  Temporarily in my mouth, forever in my heart.  Or on my hips.  It was not diet food, it was covered in some sort of heavenly cream cheese sauce that is the stuff dreams are made of.  It was a $60 dinner and it tasted like one too.  

My friend ordered the blackened sea bass and it came out looking like a work of art.  Both our dishes were basically food porn.  He loved his dinner too and said that his fish came out topped with large chunks of crab and he loved it.

We were waayyy too full to even think about dessert.  I'm sure the desserts would have been divine but we just could not do it.  In fact I ended up taking half my filet home with me.

This place is technically expensive, but if you think about it, it's really not that bad.  Our bill came to $200 for the two of us, but for what you get, it's really a pretty damn good deal.  You get top notch service, the restaurant itself is beautiful, and the food is absolutely incredible.  This was probably the best meal I have had in Pittsburgh.  Oh--and you get enough food that you get a full meal the next day.

Overall, this place has quick service and throws in lots of big chunks of fresh vegetables. When's the last time you had vegetable fried rice with chunks of bell pepper, broccoli, pea pods, and onion. The Kung Pao chicken could be spicier but next time I'll ask.

Also, there are free extras when you order $20 or more (such as a 2 liter of Pepsi).

Update:  Much to my great sadness and disappointment, I have had to stop patronizing this establishment due to the extremely rude and unprofessional man they hired to answer the phone.  We tolerated it the first few times, even got a laugh out of the fact that he actually dropped the F bomb a few times while taking our order.   But when he became hostile and irate with me on a recent order, it was all over.  He started like he always does by laughing at our street name and having me spell it 5 times, then interrupted the order without excusing himself to set down the phone and yell at some children I heard in the background, then he argued with me about what the menu in my hand said, telling me I was wrong and it said something different.  He was aggressive, frustrated, impatient and clearly has some psychological problems.

Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the ""deal"" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.

Moving from LA recently where for some reason EVERYTHING is more expensive... except nail salons! Now, I am by no means, a spa rat but I do like to pamper the toes every now and again. So one afternoon when I had some spare time, I gave them a try. I was totally underwhelmed. From nail polish in the front with dust on it (how long have they been there?) To sitting in a spa chair with ripped upholstery I felt neither pampered nor impressed. I MIGHT have looked beyond such things because of the affordable price till I got home and realized that my nails hadn't been cut short as I had very clearly asked nor had she taking care of an ingrown toenail. A week later I had to cut my own toes and ruin my all right looking pedicure. This place doesn't feel clean or inviting. The decor was junkie and old and cluttered.

I tried to peruse the menu before ordering but I couldn't find it online anywhere which is disappointing because the hard copy they have available had at least 300 different options from apps, combos, sides, and entrees. 

I got their General Tso's Chicken (extra spicy) and because my order was a take-out over $12, they threw in two free egg rolls. #win 

(Other offers are Free 1 Small Fried Rice w/purchase of $16, Free General Tso's or Sesame Chicken w/purchase over $28)  

I called on my way there and it took about 10-15 .... When I walked in, everything was ready to go. Large portion of chicken was served in plastic and rice was in standard paper folder container. They were not stingy about duck sauce, soy sauce, and fortune cookies. #win #win

Just like the reviews below, the General Tso's was just so-so. It definitely wasn't extra spicy but it did have a mild kick to it. To me, the sauce tasted a bit like wing sauce from a dive bar. I would get it again because it was good but it didn't have an oriental flavor to it. When ordering from a strip mall Chinese food place, I always expect each piece of General Tso's to be a quarter chicken and the rest fatty breading to which I dissect and just eat the meat.  My expectations were met but I wasn't disappointed because the chicken was good. 
The meal had a decent amount of broccoli in it which was cooked perfectly for my taste, a little firmer. 

The egg rolls were OK. Super crispy and not much filling...plenty of oil. They were free and so I can't really complain.  

I will definitely eat here again. I'll probably try Sha Cha chicken because it's spicier or Kung Po. This place is good if you want cheap food that will hit a Chinese take-out craving.

I went in with the intention of buying a jacket, helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). 

I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the ""hated"" that jacket and that the liner was ""nothing more than a glorified garbage bag."" Ok...

We also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?

Even after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.

When I tried to pay with a bank-issued check, I had to wait around for nearly 20 minutes before they told me that they have never seen a bank-issued check and sent me on my way.

The entire time I was there, it felt like they thought I just stole a bunch of money and were treating me like a crook. I am definitely not going back to complete the transaction. If I'm going to be buying an expensive piece of machinery, I really expect the service to at least be a little more enthusiastic.

The cheese is all melty on the top and it's yum yum delicious! You have to try it. The only other pizza joint that I can think of that is anything similar is Beto's over on Banksville Road in Dormont (or Greentree, where's the line?)

This is take out only. No eating there guys. Also, there's not really a ""small"" option and all of their pizza's are square. If that's a problem, find another pizza joint!

First bite the crust was almost raw, dense, and way too chewy.  The sauce tasted sour and the cheese (shredded, not dices provolone like the Original) was slimy.  My second bite, the crust was burned, tasted burned, but at least it was crunchy.  There was no third bite.  The remaining slices got tossed in the garbage.

For anyone familiar with other DiCarlo's, it is the same shape (square) and sold by the slice, and has the same crunchy yet chewy crust.  The cheese is grated like the cheese at the Elm Grove DiCarlo's location in Wheeling, but the sauce is more like most of the other DiCarlo's (there's just something special about the Elm Grove sauce that hasn't been replicated in the other branches).

The North Side has struggled for years to try to gentrify and it's been a slow process. If more places like The Park House would open in the neighborhood the effect could be exponential.

I've been a patron for just about a year on the dot.  I can honestly say that I drove by more than a few times and didn't stop (even though friends recommended it) because I didn't know what I would find.  Boy, I wish I had that time back!  
I'll start with FREE... popcorn, peanuts in the shell, great people, and music - yes, live music for FREE.  And, it's all good. Now, to elaborate...

I live in Lawrenceville and crossing a river to go to a place in Pittsburgh is nearly unheard of. But, the people here are so awesome, I can't stay away.  Young, old, hippies, hipsters, locals, and happen-uponers all converging to create an amazing atmosphere.  Last night, there was a woman and her family from Seattle in addition to the familiar faces I usually see.  As other reviewers mentioned, it is like CHEERS - it only takes a couple of visits before folks on both sides of the bar know your name and you!  

Of course the free snacks are awesome, they're free - and you can just toss your peanut shells wherever you'd like (my mom would be horrified to watch me throw them on the floor :)  BUT, THE MENU... WOAH.  Zamir makes his own hummus, falafel, tabuouli, and golani.  OMG it's ALL FABULOUS!  Last week I tried the golani platter for the first time -- a golani patty, hummus, feta, and tomatoes, served with pita.  The golani made me smile - spinach, carrots, spices, cheese -- it makes you want to eat your veggies!  I really had to decide last night between the golani platter and the Peace in the Middle East (tabouli, hummus, falafel, pita).  I was really craving the ""falafel master"" delicacy, so Peace it was.

Beer. Um, there is a lot of it... imports, crafts, and domestics.  If you can't find something to drink here then you must not be thirsty.  I think there are 20 taps... I've never actually counted, but a chalkboard boasts their fine selection (stop in and count them, and let me know).  I'm a micro dork and have always been completely overwhelmed by my choices during any given beer season.  Also, there is a ""worst beer"" (it's never bad) discounted selection and some ""last chance"" items that are usually around $4/bottle or glass. 

Now, music can be a tricky thing. But like everything else here, it's never steered me away.  Every Wednesday is a bluegrass jam in the rear of the establishment.  Mostly it's members of the Shelf Life String Band, but they are often joined by folks who just want to sit in and play.  You may hear some bluegrass versions of Radiohead, The Coasters, Gorillaz in addition to ""trad-grass"" favorites.  Every Friday night there is live music by local and touring musicians and, like the popcorn and peanuts, IT'S ALWAYS FREE!

We had a server who was efficient despite being slammed once the music started. I give her mad props, b/c I was not without a beer throughout the entire set.  That scores major points in my book.  I noted that people also seemed to be getting drinks at the bar timely as well.

Long narrow bar with lots of wood and a few tables to sit at. They had a good selection of beers on tap that were seasonal and would satisfy any beer lover.  The free popcorn and peanuts were a nice touch.

As for the bluesgrass jam night I can't really recommend it. I was worried that it would be a bunch of hipsters standing in a circle pretending to be the Lumineers, and it was. This is not bluegrass.  Also with a name like bluegrass jam it attracts other sparsely washed hipsters like ants to an overripe peach.

The food is solid, albeit limited due to their small kitchen space. I would recommend the hummus more than anything else. It's the one that that's stood out to us on our visits. Everything else is decent, but nothing special.

My one complaint is the cost of the whisky. I think Laphroaig 10 was $15 for a pour. That's way too pricey for a 10 year old Scotch that's only $50/bottle across the street at the Wine & Spirits. Otherwise, the beer selection is decent, as well as their limited, but decent bourbon selection.

I have a DSLR that I got from my father - it had never been cleaned or adjusted. It had been having some trouble with the battery, so I took it to the only place in Pittsburgh (apparently) that will help with this. A dark-haired guy greeted me as I walked in and treated me like a total noob, and his demeanor made me feel like the dirt under his shoes. However, he did give me good information and service about my camera when prompted by another man in the shop (who I might assume is Bernie). 

They told me they could send it to the manufacturer where they'd clean it for a couple hundred bucks, but instead they cleaned out the sensors and the lens right there at the counter and checked the contacts between the lens and the camera. The dark-haired guy showed me through a magnifying glass what I was looking at, and explained that some spots I saw in the viewfinder were inside the top of the camera and wouldn't appear on the pictures. The other guy (Bernie?) explained to me some of the functions of the camera -- I knew these already, but it was nice to hear them explained and he showed me a few examples. They advised me to get a UV filter to protect my lens, which I knew was overpriced but I happily bought anyway to pay for their service. 

So I think the kind of experience you get depends entirely on the person you run into. I can see how someone would be put off by the dark haired guy I ran into first, and how someone would absolutely love the service from the other guy. All in all I'm pleased with my encounter with this shop, but I probably won't buy anything from there considering how overpriced it was -- however, if something goes wrong or I need any service, I'll definitely go back.",0,bockWFDA3mzjuujY7tOcaw,0,3,2013-07-06,review,0

I noticed another customer who was new to photography was receiving quality advise from an exceedingly patient salesman, showing that they are not elitist but inviting about photography. They know their stuff and are very helpful.

It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.

Randy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. 

The brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope).

2473,sYonLXU0zgZGGaRDJRPxXw,nVVl8xL4CIQfIygXnzvhGQ,"Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  

My initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.

And I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a ""what's going on here"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.

Finally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.

My first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: ""Uh-oh"".  The menu is huge with a number of ""slow-food"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.

I ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  

Sadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.

My sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The ""bacon"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, ""meat"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  

Max's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, ""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service"".

That's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.

If you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.

Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely had worse meals in Germany as well.

Max's is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original hotel building.  The exception is the bar area that's good for happy hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  But the bar area is also tasteful and pleasant to be in.  Max's has a full bar, but their real specialty is their excellent selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.

I haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty much all offered here.  The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious as well.  Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures that even a picky child will have something to enjoy here), but my two favorite menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, although the sauerkraut is also very good.  I don't care for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served cold, but Max's offers the kind that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served warm.  Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent rendition of it.

If you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  The basement ""Rathskellar"" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  It would be a good place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.  Depending on the size of your group, you can arrange to have a buffet-style dinner, or individuals in the group can order directly off the regular dinner menu.",0,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,5,2009-01-20,review,1

My favorite dinner here is Max's Goulash.  Its a great beef stew with spaetzle and you can get potato pancakes on the side.  The potato pancakes are, without a doubt, the best in Pittsburgh!!

While the food is fantastic, the staff and customer service is what keeps this place from being really excellent.  Its a very ""come as you are"" sort of place and rightfully so as it's a tavern/restaurant but the staff may take the casual nature of the restaurant a little too seriously.

One evening about a year ago, I went in for dinner.  I originally thought to sit at a wooden booth in the bar and there was only 1 open, the last towards the back.  I sat down and the seat completely collapsed on me!  I'm far from what you'd call ""fat"" ""heavy set"" or even a ""big girl"" and the staff just sort of stared at me as though it were my fault that their booth just fell apart, the bartender even laughed at me while I tried to get up.  No one asked if I was ok, no one asked if I needed help and I was generally ignored as I tried to pull myself to my feet.

*I* had to approach the hostess, tell her that the booth had just collapsed and ask to be reseated.  She rolled her eyes at me and told me the dining room was full so I'd have to wait.  

Ok, understandable... could you offer a drink or a manager or something while I waited considering the fact that your booth just broke apart?

The entire incident was either completely ignored by staff, like it never happened or I was looked at like it was my fault.  I didn't even get so much as an apology!

I've been back a couple of times since then because the food is always good but I always sit in the dining room now which is sort of a shame because I actually like the bar atmosphere better.  

Luckily for me though, their menu is online and they offer take out.  Unfortunately, they have the hostess answering those phone calls and since she's not a server, she doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the menu.  When I asked for a total, I was put on hold for a couple of minutes.  She finally came back and I asked how long and was put on hold again so she could go ask the kitchen.  She was quite rude about it, like I was bothering her.

Bottom line: Max's *is* the best place for German food in Pittsburgh, hands down.  But, the food is the only thing you're going for.  The staff could use some help on customer service.",0,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,3,2011-04-06,review,0

Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a variety of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst, bratwurst, and Weisswurst. The portion was large! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal. Maybe the breads and side salad filled me up. :) In my opinion, it was good but doesn't do well as a leftover.

Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)

We'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.

The spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.

Drink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.

For dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.

We finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.

Its a bit pricey (~$15/person), but the quality and quantity is superb.  The service is pretty good.  The atmosphere has a nice feel to it, perhaps its the antiquity.. I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.

Now, to the food:
The bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.

The sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.  My favorite, though, is the schnitzel liechtenstein, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  Fresh and delicious everytime.

I most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.

All together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.

I really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  

The omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  

But the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  

The desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.

We sat at the bar and had a drink and in what must have been only ten minutes we were asked if we would mind eating at a booth in the bar area rather than wait for the dinning room.  We were thrilled, because we were considering eating at the bar.  The booth worked out just fine.  It wasn't too noisy and  we got served quickly.  Even though there were several specials that tempted us, we both ordered the best thing on the menu - their Jäger Schnitzel, with sides of hot German potato salad and sweet and sour cabbage.  I had a German black lager and my wife a glass of wine.  The basket of assorted rolls comes with delicious apple butter and sauerkraut relish, both very tasty.  The schnitzel is quite large, and we only made it about halfway thru when we asked for a to-go box.  We're looking forward to finishing it here at home.

We were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.

Our waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.

Overall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre.

I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good.

My partner has been in the basement before for various work-related functions, but I had never been there, despite driving by on numerous occasions. 

    We easily found on-street parking and entered the restaurant. I immediately loved the decor in the entry room/bar area, and those pleasant furnishings continued into the more intimate rear room where we were seated. We enjoyed the beautiful wall tapestries, and I thought the old newspaper-like menus were pretty cool! I was surprised (in a good way) at the old-fashioned urinals in the men's room. In a city that has struggled to nourish and revitalize its history over the years I was already a fan of how unique Max's was in the regard of feeling ""authentic"" in an era of predictable chains.

     We were initially enticed by the prospect of ordering fried soft pretzels stuffed with cheese as a shared appetizer only to find out they were not available. We settled for the non-cheese-stuffed version, which were ""melt in your mouth"" good and were handsomely complemented by tangy honey mustard. We were a bit dehydrated after walking miles around the city, yet our waitress was very attentive in consistently replenishing our water glasses as soon as they were half-empty. I was craving a burger but was tempted instead by the fried fish sandwich, which I ordered with a side of potato pancakes and applesauce. My partner ordered a fried chicken sandwich with the same side I did.

The fish tasted fresh, although I wasn't a fan of having to pick small bones out of my mouth in exchange for enjoying that freshness. The bread it was served upon was tasty as well. The potato pancakes were thick, fresh, and were delicious when enjoyed with the chunky applesauce. My partner also thoroughly enjoyed his own sandwich.

Bigger parties tend to chat a little more and take longer in my experience. I felt like they were sort of rushing us out. That might be because they closed the dining room door and started vacuuming the front bar room while we were still finishing up our dinner. I'm not sure if anyone was eating out there but I'm very happy we weren't because it seems really gross to me to vacuum around food. This was around 9:15 and I'm pretty sure they serve until 10. 

Besides that, our service was good and so was the food. We all split the stuffed pretzels and potato skins as an appetizer. The pretzels are delicious, I could have eaten them all myself! Deep-fried and stuffed with cheese, yummy! 

I ordered the Chicken Viennese and was pleased with my meal. It came with a choice of two sides and I went with a delicious sweet potato casserole and my favorite thing of the night: POTATO PANCAKES. I prefer sour cream, but you can also get applesauce. Yum yum yum get lots of potato pancakes! The chicken was delicious and was served over spaetzel, which was just ok. I've had the kase spaetzel there before which is served in a cheese sauce and much better than the regular.

The bar is awesome. Wish we had more time just to chill and drink. But our waitress was awesome, attentive and knowledgeable! Order a REAL beer. Something on tap from Germany. (If not, I'll give you dirty looks from behind my coffee cup.)

What you should order: The Sampler Platter. Pick three amazing entrees, two awesome sides. Brilliant for $16.95... best deal on the menu. And if they have a meatball appetizer you want this. You do. 

So which entrees: 
 - Schnitzel. Whichever one you're drooling over. Personally Jager Schnitzel is always best because God blessed the world when he made mushrooms, and man praised God by making mushroom sauce.
 - Leberkase. Wow. This was fantastic. It's like a cross between liverwurst (but NOT made with liver) and a meatloaf. Fantastisch.
 - Weisswurst. It was good. I've had better and yes I know its a German faux pas to have weisswurst at any other time of day than a midmorning snack... however. it was still yummy and I happily moaned with each bite i consumed with mustard.

So which sides: 
 - Spaetzle! Buttery goodness. Never had it or heard of it? Think little dumplings. In butter. Es ist wunderbar.
 - Sauerkraut... they make theirs with sausage. what?! Ja... mmmmm.
 - Potato Pancakes. You order these with applesauce. you hear me? applesauce.

What to avoid... that's pretty harsh but they lost a star for a reason:
 - German Potato Salad was too sweet and soupy. My great grandma's recipe puts this to shame.
 - IF you don't like mustard (weirdo) the Sauerbraten has a mustard sauce. I like it, but others don't. You've been warned.

We walked here from the ballpark... took about 15 minutes. Worth the walk both ways and they treated us well despite me wearing a Cardinals shirt in a foreign land.

This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:

Brunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.

Appetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.

Meals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I also don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.

Sides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!

Dessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.

Besides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.",4,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,3,4,2014-06-03,review,6

The restaurant is located in a tired part of town. It isn't in a bad area, but I'm not sure how I would feel eating there after dark. When you walk in you walk through the tavern portion of the restaurant, which is dark and gloomy. We were escorted to the rear of the tavern, which is covered in B&W pictures from the 40's, which gives it a old world tired feeling.

The menu choices were standard faire for a true german restaurant. I had Max's Goulash, which said it came with spaetzle, but it is piled in the bottom of the bowl and not on the side, which was okay. The goulash was too vinegary for my tastes, but it was okay.

I like their pork egg roll but it is pretty different from others.  It is mainly vegetable (Cabbage I believe) and pork.  Their egg drop soup is pretty decent.

I can't say I am impressed with their other dishes.  I've had curry chicken, shrimp fried rice, chicken soup, shrimp egg roll.  They were definitely edible just no where near as flavorful as the beef lo mien.  The chicken soup was horrible.  It was bland and the noodles were lo mien noodles.  Fried rice were ok but I've had much much better at other places.  They have a huge menu though so it'll take some time to go through them.

How I have never noticed it when walking by it on East Ohio Street, not 10 minutes from my house, I will never understand.  Maybe because the entrance is set back from the sidewalk a bit, so it looks dark (i.e. possibly closed) when you first walk by.  Or maybe because it's overshadowed by the Isaly's next door.  Please, I beg of you, fellow Yelpers, don't ignore this place any longer!

Please note, as other reviewers have, that North Shore Deli is cash only.  But believe me, you won't need much.  They do have a website that really just lists the sandwiches they offer and their hours or see my photo of the menu board showing the sandwiches available (all named after local streets).  

It was difficult to decide on just one sandwich.  But after reading the few reviews here, I decided to go with the hot sausage.  When I first arrived, the meat was still cooking.  I didn't mind, I told the gentleman I would return and took a stroll over to Priory for some sweet treats for later.  When I returned, I was the only patron there but was greeted again and friendly small talk ensued.  I opted for a side of macaroni salad as well.  

When I got home and unwrapped my sandwich, I was surprised by the hot sausage that looked like it was exploding at both ends.  And that it was, my friends.  Exploding with flavor, that is.  The ends were crispy and delicious and the sausage was just hot enough that the macaroni salad was the perfect cool salad compliment.

Luckily, you can buy a variety of chilled beers at the front desk, which is open 24 hrs). The local pizza place delivers until 2 am.  It's walking distance to the Andy Warhol Museum.

We found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.

I slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.

Even without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.

For the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park. The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle.

2593,ETEM1dZOu6Qtp6jlzWyOfA,beBv0IaZ4MFp28YVBFNkmA,"My wife and I stayed at The Priory when we went out to Pittsburgh for Superbowl weekend. 

The hotel is beautiful inside and out. We don't normally stay in nice hotels, so we were surprised by how nice it was, especially the extremely comfortable king-sized bed. It made for the perfect romantic getaway in a hectic weekend filled with bars, parties, and souvenir shopping on The Strip.

There are some things you should know before you book at The Priory, however. The hotel is right across the street from a housing project. There isn't enough parking, especially if The Grand Hall is hosting a wedding when you arrive. If you get a room that is street-adjacent you may be woken up by sounds like people talking or shoveling the sidewalk. 

Overall, none of these things bothered me that much (aside from getting woken up by the snow shoveler, but I suppose that was better than cracking my head on an icy sidewalk later!). However, if you're the type of person who gets easily annoyed at minor inconveniences or gets uncomfortable around lots of african-americans, you may want to stay at the Doubletree or Westin or something. 

If you're looking for a charming boutique hotel and you're not afraid of being on the North Side, you should definitely check out The Priory.",0,hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w,0,4,2011-02-19,review,1
2594,uh-AusMLL3_83q0ywp_2XQ,yecnEyR_pKy407BaUu2Ssg,"Such a cute hotel!  I like to find non-chain hotels, but sometimes that can be scary...  The Priory was great!  Lots of character, not at all scary, very clean, modern, comfy - all the things you want in a hotel.  Well - the beds COULD be more comfortable.  It amazes me that hotel reviews rarely mention the bed.  To me, that is the most important part.  

The bed:  Too hard, for one thing.  The linens were great, very soft, and the comforter was perfect - light but warm.  However, the headboard was only loosely connected to the bed and - well, let's just say noisy.

We only stayed one night, so can't expand too much.  Breakfast didn't look too appetizing, so we went elsewhere.  The stairs are very squeaky but you can't hear them inside the rooms.  The elevator is great.  The bar was nice - small, but a great place to stop for a nightcap on your way back in for the evening.  

I had made some specific request - away from the elevator, not facing the street, etc. - they fulfilled all of them.  I love it when a hotel pays attention!

2595,nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ,kqIta40BR_aBjO1Zavi9Yw,"One thing Pittsburgh is not known for, but should be, is turning old churches into businesses, homes and even bars (gasp!).  Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! 

If you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). 

It's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! 

The Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!

There's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   

It's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!  It's a great way to see the city!

2596,wJl6K7xA_r8iuj5Mp2ngFA,X075uq1d0VzbIwtVojUNNA,"We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects?  UGH.  Great.  

Then we were put into a ""historical"" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  

I find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old ""historical"" creepy room.  

Finally, a regular room-- the ""renovated"" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room?  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? 

I slept well in the ""new"" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. 

The hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  

I don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live?  I will spend more next time.

Breakfast was ""eh"".  It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon.  OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available.

My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.",0,hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w,0,1,2014-09-17,review,1

In spite of the hotel being located in the less-than-revered North Side of the city, the place has charm and character with a friendly, accommodating staff.  At no point did I feel unsafe, although in full disclosure, I did not spend considerable time in the hotel's neighborhood, other than to frequent a nearby watering hole, the James Street Gastropub and Speakeasy.  The hotel has ample complimentary parking nearby (one lot across the street, another around the block), including one lot that is only accessible to hotel guests.  The other lot is posted to only permit hotel guests to park there but there did not appear to be a way to monitor this, although it is possible (likely?) hotel staff does so.  In addition to the friendliness of the staff and shuttle service to the stadium, the continental breakfast that was provided was pleasantly surprising in that in addition to the typical fare (cereal, muffins, danish, hard boiled eggs, coffee, etc.), there was a generous selection of meats, cheeses, and fruits.

The interior is dated, but clean and has some character. You enter though the bar and the dining room is on your right, this being a Sunday afternoon though, the dining room was not open. No biggie, I'll saddle up to the bar which seats about 12 people. The bartender was very nice, introduced herself and wanted to get to know me. 

This seems like a mostly locals only bar, but they are very happy when people from outside the neighborhood stop in. One thing I heard several times while I was in there was ""Troy Hill is getting better, more people should come here and find out.""

I tried the soup of the day, chicken and corn chowder, and an order of their wings, $.60 during the Steelers games. Both were very good and made me want to come back to try more of the menu. The beer selection is a bit limited, they mostly stick with the big name domestics, but that being said, the beer is pretty darn cheap. Sam Adams Octoberfest was $2.50 a glass or $12 a pitcher!

While I may go back to Pittsburgh some day, I will never return to the Carnegie Museum of Art. 

It's not that I mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others I have viewed (sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures) or that one whole gallery was blown glass and I felt like I was at a bong shop on haight st. in sf. 

It comes down to the fact that a docent, while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it, told the students it was a watchtower ""from Auschwitz, a place where they basically fried a lot of Jews"".  Seriously? That's how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers? It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint...""oh that place? they basically just fry eggs"".

On top of all that, the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler's rule (i.e. not those in Auschwitz).

In sum, docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer, and this one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, if you're going to hire racist people to lead your tours, at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read).",0,EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ,1,1,2007-05-23,review,0

You seem to recall that those are in London. Isn't there an ongoing controversy about repatriating them to Greece?

Oh. Wow. Oh, ok. They're all plaster casts. That's sort of cool, I guess. Maybe I'm a bit slow on the uptake. So, move along. The contemporary art works are pretty fantastic, particularly a Rachel Whiteread piece, a video installation filmed supposedly in a semi-trailer, and a sculpture using mirrors. Also, there is some great Pgh related art. Especially the painting of the dog from the firebrigade.

Go over to the Natural History Museum. Appreciate the fact that the displays were constructed before people worried about portrayals of violence and proceed to play a pretty fun game of Spot-the-Dead-Thing-in-the-Diorama. And trust me, nearly every diorama includes a death. Go into the wood paneled room (yep) and walk into an area that is tucked away and looks like an after-thought to see a badger. It's a pretty great badger, as far as they go.

When I moved to Pittsburgh, they had this sort of omnibus exhibit of their own permanent collection called (somewhat inappropriately) Panopticon and arranged kind of Barnes Collection style. That was cool. But on subsequent visits, the permanent galleries were equally impressive and even more pleasurable in their everyday arrangements. 

I might be mistaken, but I think that even everyday the paintings are hung above one another, not all in a straight line in a white box of a room, ala the Metropolitan's modern collection. 

I also think the furniture collection is pretty exciting and the Teenie Harris Collection and Project is fascinating. 

I will say, though, that in six years I was never once moved to go to any of the special exhibitions they hosted. 

I guess it's important to note, too, that the art and natural history museums are attached to one another (and located in Oakland), and one admission covers both.

Remember how everything was in straight lines and the dinosaurs were up on their big pedestals?  Now the exhibit is sort of S-shaped, the walls are painted with colorful murals, the support columns are disguised as trees, there are plants around the dinosaurs and dead leaves underneath.  Underneath every dinosaur is a nameplate with a lot of information and a touchscreen with even MORE information, including a section on how the Carnegie Museum researchers contributed to the discovery or naming of this dinosaur.  There is a lot more natural light than I remember, and there are 2 balconies that overlook the exhibits for more photo opportunities.  There is also an extensive timeline of the Carnegie Museum's expeditions and contributions to paleontology, and a timelapse video of the renovations.

The cons: The rest of the history museum is pretty lame compared to this new and awesome exhibit.  The biggest examples are the 2nd floor Halls of African and North American Wildlife and the 3rd floor Birds hall.  Big cases of taxidermy in a wood-paneled room with dim lighting - hardly thrilling.  The 3rd floor Polar World is starting to look dated too.  Even the fonts used date the exhibits.

Admission is now $15 for adults, $11 for students (free for Pitt students!).

To say that the Carnegie is THE Pittsburgh Cultural Institution is indeed an understatement and as I live in nearby Squirrel Hill, I am so happy to have it within walking distance.  Although the day I visited, I rode my bike and parked it all day.  (Note to Yelp'er Mike O. from Park Ridge, IL--I didn't wipe out this time!).

I decided to spend the entire day at the Carnegie, and believe me it was worth it!  As Emily H. says, the Dinosaurs in their time was really worth it!  It went from being a stuffy, dull, ""stuffed and mounted"" exhibit to being a really neat walk-through one.  The murals really give the exhibit a sense of time and place.  The exhibit shows how the plants, mammals, fish, and insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological diversity that surrounds us today.

A long-time favorite of mine is the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems.  I've always loved the bright colors of the gems and could stand there for hours in hushed awe of these beautiful stones.  The museum just added the Wertz Gallery of Gems and Jewelry to the Hillman Hall.  The gallery has an extensive collection of birthstones, giving the history of each and how birthstones came to be.  The current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from H.J. Heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece.

But as much as I enjoy natural science, I really love art.  The Carnegie Museum of Art includes  American art from the late nineteenth century, French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, and European and American decorative arts.   The Heinz Architectural is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.  I particularly enjoy Asian art and the Carnegie has an extensive collection of Japanese prints.  

One special exhibit that I really recommend will be there only until October 18, 2008 and it is ""Abstract Art before 1950: Watercolors, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs"".  It consists of avant-garde works by European, American, and Japanese artists.

The Natural History Museum is a dinosaur lover heaven. The fossils are seriously awesome, especially the one that you see when you walk in (that is still in the huge rock face.)  Just a great collection and definitely a good place for families.

The art museum has some great items in it - the Monet probably stands out for most people. I loved the ""Chariot of Aurora"" installation - a 32 panel wall that once graced the luxury cruiseliner Normandie. There were plenty of gems in the modern collection besides the Monet - loved the John Singer Sargent and the Bourgerou. 

Also impressive was the Hall of Architecture and the Hall of Sculpture. These transform you into another place and time while you are there. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent here and would not hesitate to come here again. Highly recommended.",3,EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ,1,5,2010-11-24,review,6

It is cheap to get in (it used to be by ""donations"", but I'm not sure if it still is... you can also buy into a membership program) and it is a really awesome way to spend an afternoon! 

There is a cafe in the art museum (and if I remember correctly, a cafeteria in the natural history) that serves sandwiches and the like.. there is also a nice sized gift shop. 

Metered parking outside or a lot that you can enter near the entrance to the art museum is a great option. The building itself is impressive looking.

Coming from Houston where we have some pretty good museums, this was a pleasant surprise - really cheap considering you get both Art and Natural History.
The dinosaur exhibit was so interesting and educational.  The gem and mineral exhibit was huge. And the art museum had a surprisingly awesome collection - I was thrilled to see a couple Van Goghs, Monets, Cezannes, etc.
The only exhibit I didn't much care for was the temporary art exhbit - some contemporary craziness that involved body parts dangling from the ceiling.. at least it gave us something to talk about.
All in all I did not spend nearly as much time here as I could have and would have liked. I highly recommend this for anyone visiting Pittsburgh.",1,EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ,0,4,2011-04-28,review,2
2679,u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw,woEBjyOF5h8IyHYPWAzCqA,"I lived outside of New York for 7 years.   We went to theaters, clubs, restaurants, yet I NEVER went to any of the museums or any of the tourist sights.  Why?  Because I could do that anytime, right?  Then I left and I look back and think, ""Why the hell didn't I go to the Empire State building?""  Now, every time I go back to NY, I try to knock off at least one tourist thing and one museum, in addition to the usual list of restaurants, etc.

I realized I was about to fall in to the same trap here in Pittsburgh.  I've been here a year and eaten about about every conceivable restaurant in the city, been to most of the bars, but I haven't been to many of the attractions that people talk about that make the city so great.  

So I have made a list--a list of things to do in Pittsburgh if I were a tourist.  And every Saturday, I will do at least ""One Cool Thing in Pittsburgh.""  Today was day one--and today was THE CARNEGIE MUSEUMS in Oakland.

My first comment is, man, am I tired.  That is one big museum.  We started out by visiting the Biennial exhibition--a collection of Pittsburgh Artists.  The work was mixed--the photography exhibition was strong; I was a little underwhelmed by some of the other work--but either way, it was awesome to see the work on display and it speaks to the vibrant arts scene here.  

The layout of the permanent collection is one of the most logical and easily flowing I've ever seen.  And the collections, while not huge, are all solid.  Definitely the 'right' pieces for someone who wants a nice overview of a period of time.  

We were already tired by the time we got through the second floor (we never did go down to one) collection and decided we had to at least check out the dinosaurs.  

Awesome.

Got some geological history on the way.   By the time we saw the T Rex, we were both in need of a beer.  As we walked out, we upgraded our tickets to a dual membership.  We'll definitely be back.

Can't wait to see what's next on the list.",4,EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ,3,4,2011-06-25,review,6
2680,amF5o9feu5-DakVlaDxcaw,YC41vx1Tt0JlN0dQ564a-g,"Pittsburgh is viewed by many as a 3rd rate city - it is most certainly not. the carnegie museum(s) and surrounding area alone prove what a great city pittsburgh really is. ive only visited this museum once, and i hate it when yelpers have one bad outing as their only experience and give a 1 star rating. GROW UP PEOPLE.
that being said - theres plenty negative things to say about this place. lots of wasted space. i was astounded by the large area (and time i spent) wasted on replicas! its great for the children to see, dont get me wrong. but ""ok heres some more fake stuff from 'a long time ago' from the other side of the world."" and the fake jemstones...i just dont get why i would go to a museum to look at what basically amounts to counterfeits. also, the day i was there was very empty, dead in most every area. that is normally a blessing, but at this place it gives the nazi 'security' staff members your personal undivided attention. they have a rule here that your backpack only be carried ON ONE SHOULDER, and if you are wearing it properly on both shoulders they yell at you. i had 2 women who (after asked 2 or 3 times) followed me around from room to room and stared at me waiting for me to move a strap off my arm....or course being an immature man-child i gave her what she wanted. ""that backpack looks too heavy for you! come down with me and check it in a locker."" yeah right lady...it was baffling to me why they would insist on this as a huge deal, so i asked someone ""in charge"" later (while i was being rule-abiding one shoulder museum goer) and she explained that ""people that wear their backpacks correctly forget that theyre wearing them, and turn around abruptly and knock over things or people""!!! [oops i forgot that im wearing this on my back, and have now knocked over this fake inexpensive museum piece]. i asked her if she realized its not good for the bags OR your back to wear them incorrectly and she said the museum is more important than those things. then - with my pack on one shoulder - i said ""oh...ok"" then whipped my backpack around and hit her on the side, because i forgot it was there!

2681,8bUxL5nXbWKwyNnNn2TcSA,gL8RqEHvOgbT2AOHtdYcjw,"I'm from Detroit. We have a decent art museum, but nothing this awesome.

The Carnegie Museum houses two very nice museums. Natural History and Art. The Natural History Museum is very impressive and it's cool knowing that all the specimens belong to the museum and they aren't on loan from some hoity-toity New York museum. It's not huge like the Smithsonian, but it's certainly cool seeing real dinosaur bones. My accompaniment had to stifle all my Jurassic Park ""Mr. DNA"" references.

The art section is also quite impressive. I personally still prefer my Detroit Institute of Art, but this museum is still nice. I got a little confused about how to walk around. I prefer my museums in chronological order, not cool to less cool, which is what this seems to be. The modern art is very cool, but after being at the Warhol the day before, I had my fill of high-concept stuff. There's quite a bit of Impressionism, which by scientific fact all women love.

Every year they do an art in bloom exhibit which I love!!!  Where local florist will make arrangements to go a long with different paintings or sculptures on exhibit, I've never seen anything like it before. 
If you receive public assistance you can get $1.00 admission for up to 4 people, and if you have a family member or friend who does TELL THEM, that is really a measure of good faith on behalf of the Carnegie Museum.",3,EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ,1,5,2012-02-05,review,3
2683,iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA,OiFWijPQl91gnuT2h1aJ1Q,"Well Susan the Procrastinator had left yet another review pending for a couple of weeks!  Anyway, my mom and I went to the Carnegie Museum of Art to see the exhibit, ""Read My Pins: The Madeleine Albright Collection"".  We went  on March 4, 2012 the day it closed.  O' but I'm so glad we saw it, albeit at the last minute!  

Madeline Albright has always been one of  my favorite women in politics.  In 1997, Albright was named the first female Secretary of State and became, at that time, the highest ranking woman in the history of the U.S. government.  Prior to that, she was Ambassador to the U.N.  While serving under President Bill Clinton, first as U.S ambassador to the United Nations, and then as Secretary of State, Albright became known for wearing brooches that purposefully conveyed her views about the situation at hand.  She was famous for saying, ""While President George H.W. Bush had been known for saying 'Read my lips,' I began urging colleagues and reporters to 'Read my pins.'""

In 1994, Saddam Hussein's government-controlled press referred to then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Albright as an ""unparalleled serpent."" She then wore a golden snake brooch to her next meeting on Iraq,  

I was really quite enthralled by the collection that Secretary Albright cultivated.  As my guide says, ""The collection is distinctive and democratic-sometimes demure and understated, sometimes outlandish and outspoken-spanning more than a century of jewelry design and including fascinating pieces from across the globe.""   Some of the pieces on display were fine antiques, such as the circa 1880 ""Blue Bird"".   But many of the pieces were costume jewelry.  

I guess my favorite piece was ""Liberty Brooch"".  Now this piece, circa 1997 by Gijs Bakker, is the head of Lady Liberty with two watch faces for eyes, one of which is upside down-allowing both her and her visitor to see when it is time for an appointment to end.  A very clever piece, and judging by the others' comments at the exhibit, I'm not the only one with that opinion.  Mom really loved it too.  

So this was a really powerful exhibit of an eclectic collection of jewelry.  I strongly recommend reading the accompanying book, ""Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat's Jewel Box"", which you can get at Barnes & Noble or Amazon.  Madeleine Albright is an inspiration to women in politics and government.",2,EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ,2,5,2012-03-13,review,2

So I stopped in to see what the museums were all about, and I was more than surprised to see the magnitude of serious works they have, the diversity of their collection, oh and dinosaurs. Two museums for the price of one really is a bargain, there's no way to not see that. The collections in BOTH museums are interesting and vast.

Different people have different ways of experiencing museums, personally I like to meander and find different things at different times. I was glad to see that I could definitely get lost here in different ways on different occasions. But no review about art and dinosaurs (natural history) is really going to cover everything the space has to offer, so I'll just say that you won't be disappointed, and who knows maybe you'll really love it.

This museum was not only a huge part of my daughters' childhoods with at least 1 visit every summer, our youngest daughter got married there. The Carnegie Museum will hold a special place in our hearts forever! 

The basic exhibits have been there since I did my school field trips (a loooong time ago!) and there have always been special rotating ones to check out and enjoy over the years. What one doesn't stop long enough to realize as you're schlepping kids from place to place is the amazing architecture of the building itself. That's what became so apparent as the wedding was taking place. The murals all around the walls and ceiling of the grand staircase area where the ceremony was held are spectacular, as well as the marble columns and staircases themselves. I had never had the opportunity to stand there and take it all in until that moment and it's pretty mind blowing how gorgeous everything truly is. 

The 2 typical places for social events at the museum are The Hall of Architecture, where our reception was held, or the Carnegie Music Hall. Both are amazing event sites. Parkhurst Dining does the catering for events at the museum. Yes, it's the catering division of Eat N Park which initially gave us pause until we did their tasting and from that point on we had no worries. They produced really spectacular food elevated far above what one considers typical banquet fare. Everyone raved about their steaks being perfectly cooked and everything arrived hot to the tables. Alice, the baker, did a phenomenal job on the wedding cake, too. I'm not even a cake person and have to say that Alice's chocolate cake with raspberries was killer! 

All the Greek and Roman Facades in the Hall of Architecture had always given me goose bumps when I walked in there over the years. Imagine it decorated for a reception! Truly unique and wonderful.

Dear Warren Buffett, don't mess with my ketchup!

FACT: Heinz Ketchup is used in 93% of restaurants, nation wide!

The HJ Heinz company was formed in 1869 when Henry John Heinz sold his mother's canned horseradish door to door. 

Today Heinz's headquarters are still here in Pittsburgh, although no products are made in Pittsburgh anymore. The plant at the base of Troy Hill near the Allegheny river was sold to Treehouse Foods where they make private label soups. I'll never forget going to the factory as a Cub Scout and how the vinegar smelled as we toured the factory. We each got a full size bottle of Ketchup to take home with us, and of course a Pickle Pin, one of the most iconic symbols associated with Heinz.

The side salad that comes with the meal would make the hall of fame for any side salad league.  It came with olives, Gorgonzola, julienned carrots and other veggies.

After walking in, Legends North Star is small but homey which was nice. The place was not filled so we had our pick of tables. Our waitresses were sweet and did not kick us out after we remained at our table to finish wine 30 minutes after closing. 

Legends North Shore provides bread to munch on. Crunchy airy pieces that don't fill you up entirely before the entree which I so often do and they provide a bottle with seasoned olive oil (which was kind of oily on the outside). I tried the Tuesday 99 cent green and beans special along with a salad and spaghetti and meatballs. I wasn't sure what the green and beans were but they were cheesy and salty but very watery. I thought they were tasty but confused if what I ate were indeed what greens and beans were suppose to be. The salad was fresh but nothing special, and I felt the same for the spaghetti and meatballs (made in house from the meatball to the pasta). I feel that when you go to an Italian restaurant you can judge how well they cook based on classic dishes. I couldn't stop eating the spaghetti and meatballs though I felt full half way through. I thought the meal was overall good though not anything spectacular and pricey for what it was - ~$18 ($17 for spaghetti and meatballs and $.99 for the greens and beans plus some tax). Maybe if they knocked a few bucks off to $13 or $14 or so it would be more reasonable imho. Also points are deducted for the corkage fee of $4 per person, not per bottle.

Pros:
-Great, friendly service. Morgan was my server and she was super fantastic. Quick, efficient, sweet. She offered up helpful suggestions and even let me try a sample of the soup of the day before I placed my order.
-Homemade focaccia: Mmmm rosemary! Tasty and free slivers of love to go with your meal.

-Spinach ravioli: My main dish of choice. Flavorful spinach and cheese pillows of pasta cooked al dente and smothered with tomato basil sauce with a touch of cream. Damn good pasta, my friends.

Cons:
-Menu items price out a few dollars higher than similar Italian joints. But, the value is here, though, because of the increased portions.

This restaurant is in a prime location on the North Side and has plenty of opportunity to capitalize on the growth in the area. That said, allow me to jump into some of the minuses:

Beans and Greens appetizer - I love beans and greens, but was shocked by the amount of garlic the chef added. Actually, I don't think it was garlic...I believe it was garlic salt (a huge no-no) Don't get me wrong, I love garlic, but there was so much that it killed a simple, rustic dish.

Blackened Shrimp Pasta - My date and I shared this dish. This dish tasted as though an entire container of garlic salt had accidentally been dropped onto the plate before being served. The shrimp and pasta, however, were cooked well. Had the chef backed off the garlic he would have presented a more edible dinner. i was not in the mood to send this dish back to the kitchen, but did call this out to the waitress once our meal concluded.

The restaurant is cute, in a great location, and service is friendly and prompt. These are all important things to me, but quality and taste takes precedence.  Unfortunately, Legends just didn't do it for me.

The focaccia bread is great with the homemade mixture of olive oil and herbs. 

I ordered the mussels bianca over linguine--terrific. Also comes with shrimp. The portions are generous but delicious, in part because it's clear that the tomato sauces are all made fresh and in-house.

They give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil.  This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me.  Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary.

My friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it.  I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright.  It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent.

We walked into the door and there was a woman standing near the door and she shot us a look of surprise (or frustration) and asked if we had a reservation? Well that wasn't the greeting I was expecting and was surprised at this question since the place was empty but within a half hour I totally understood why.

This small but quaint restaurant filled up very fast.  This establishment is just lovely and was clean and was decorated for the holiday season.  It was cozy.   The menu was small but had something for everyone and the prices weren't too bad but It might be a little pricey if you are on a budget but it's worth it trust me.   

The service was excellent.. we received beverages and bread within a moments time.  Our bread basket never remained empty either. 
We ordered the ""beans and greens"" as an appetizer and it was delicious. My Italian Mother makes this dish all the time and it was ""almost"" as good as hers - which is saying a lot.  
  
I had penne pasta with sausage, roasted red peppers, olives and artichokes.   It was very tasty but was a bit salty for my taste (think it was the olives) but still delicious.  My friend ordered the Walleye and was very pleased.  The tossed salad that came with my entree was just the right size and everything was fresh.
Fresh greens and was accompanied by carrots, red onions, feta, cherry tomatoes and olives.   By the time we were ready to leave there wasn't an empty table in the place.  
The restaurant is located on the corner at a very convenient location in North side with parking available on the street right outside the restaurant. Getting back on 279 was a snitch. 

The restroom doors were so festive and unique that I couldn't resist taking a picture !!   The restrooms were also clean too.

I love restaurants that aren't ""chains"" and have their own flair .. and this establishment has that! 

I am very happy we decided to have dinner at Legends of the North Shore and will no doubt be visiting again ...

We had reservations which are needed given the size of the place.  Maybe a capacity of 35 or 40.   We got seated right away.  I ordered the beans and greens and the Bird ordered the mussels for appetizers.  Although I tend to like beans and greens with sausage, they did not have sausage however they were really tasty.   The mussels were a nice portion and also very good.

The Bird ordered the Gnocchi with the meat sauce.  Again, it was a nice portion and they were very good!  I ordered the tortellini special which also turned out to include the ravioli.  (A nice surprise ).

The dinner salads were also above average in that they included Gorgonzola , Greek olives, and cucumber.  I wasn't that crazy about the Italian dressing but it was still ok.

Price wise our meal was around $80 which included $4 corking fee.  However we saw on the menu if you present your theater tix you get a 10% discount!  (Another nice surprise )

Parking was easy.  On street a block away.

We ordered the pasta special and it was amazing.  It was shrimp and crab ravioli in a white wine sauce, cooked with asparagus, roasted yellow peppers, and mushrooms.  It was probably the best ravioli I ever had.  It was topped with four huge pieces of shrimp cooked to perfection.  Most meals come with either soup or salad, either is guaranteed to be delicious, and some bread served with olive oil for dipping.  Some other things I've had that I really enjoyed were the spaghetti and meatball, the hot anti-pasta, and their fudge.  Everything has a very home cooked feel to it, better than mom used to make.

I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us.  They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm.  Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls.

For dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share.  It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle.  I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce.  Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing.  The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal.  The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good!  It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it.  Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better.  The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entrée that I had a treat.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  I was very happy with all of the food that we had and also loved that the prices were good for the quality of food that they were serving.",1,q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ,1,5,2013-02-21,review,2

Our server was very matter of fact and to the point. What I would expect eating at a dinner, not a nice Italian restaurant. I decided to order the Penne Vodka with prosciutto and the wedding soup. The soup was nothing memorable. I enjoyed the crisp bread (foccacia) and oil better. When the entree's arrived, I was surprised that my Penne vodka was garnished with prosciutto. I assumed from the menu that there would be more proscuitto than a thin two inch slice on top of the dish. Overall, the sauce was very good. Not too creamy, not to tomatoey.

2753,HI7byNVBtzinyLl3UCvynA,XrrT6PWfbt0vonzKqhMVmw,"We have been wanting to try Legends of the North Shore for a long time and since we were right across the street yesterday, we seized the lunch opportunity. It was not what I expected at all. Tiny I expected because I'd seen it driving by many times. Diner-esque inside, completely unexpected. I knew they are BYOB but after eating lunch here, I can't imagine any scenario where I'd take more than a couple of beers with me. Not a place to linger over a bottle of wine. Tables on top of each other, cramped and kind of a low end divey diner, uh uh.

I wanted the mussels for lunch but was told they were out of them. Not terribly disappointed because our server had just run through the lunch specials and one had caught my attention enough that I mentally considered changing my mind anyway. A fried zucchini plank sandwich with melted mozzarella and side of sauce. I do love a good zucchini plank and had never heard of anyone creating a sandwich out of them, so no hardship to change my order. 

That was a greasy, good lunch sandwich....heavy on the greasy but, I've always loved some tasty 'fried deliciousness!'

Hubs had the sausage sandwich... good...but mine was the clear winner.
Starter soups were homemade and tasty. Hubby had black bean and I had the chicken pastine, aka wedding soup. The broth rivaled my premium homemade Christmas chicken soup broth so no complaints on that. 

Overall: ambiance 1star, mine and hubby's sandwiches 3 stars, soup 4 stars. Average is a 3 - not rushing back but I'd clearly have lunch there again, if I'm across the street.",3,q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ,0,3,2013-07-04,review,2

Friends told me it wasn't worth it but I persisted to the point that we went there for lunch yesterday. My first reaction was not a pleasant one. The cheap plastic chairs, the small close together tables, the tacky decorations, not a good feel but I pressed on. 

Now, I didn't avail myself of the BYOB (might have resulted in a higher rating!!) and it was only lunch so I can't comment on dinner. Regrettably, I won't ever try them for dinner so this is the best I can offer.  I think Legends in their name only applies to the sports heroes and not any legendary food experience you'll find here. 

The place is essentially a diner. Diner atmosphere, diner chairs, diner specials, diner everything. Not that I don't appreciate diners, I do. But this atmosphere is BLAH.  I'd rate it a max of 2 stars. Max. 

Food on the other hand is ok. Not great. Ok. Worth going out of your way for? Absolutely not. I had the Parma hot sausage with a bowl of black bean soup- both things I love!!! We're these memorable? Not in the least. It's generous to say they were adequate. ""Mama's gravy"", a marinara sauce of sorts, was lackluster and flavorless. The sausage was just a split link of hot sausage and something I could replicate at home with ease. The black bean soup was listless and uninspired. Sad because i was expecting (hoping?) for so much more.  I wish I had ordered the chicken parm that the guys pressing up against me from behind ordered. It looked way better. But I'll not have that chance cause I won't be going back. I'll drive by this place a thousand times to go to other more deserving places on the Northside. 

Sorry. Didn't do it for me.  Can't even imagine coming here for dinner with a bottle of wine. Would be awful.  I wanted to give it 2 stars but felt a little generous today.

What was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse, gave me a free beer to drink, and engaged me in plenty of conversation. At one point, though, he said, ""You look oriental, but you also look American."" I'm pretty sure he wasn't meaning for it to be offensive, and I just discounted it as his being an old man who didn't know it was no longer politically correct to say things like that.

This is not why I recommend against Caruso's, however. The reason why I'll never go there again is because Sam knowingly sold me expired beer.

I was on my way back from the North Side to the East End where I live and after seeing these good reviews, I decided to stop by. I wanted a case of Yuengling, but Sam said, ""Why don't you try this instead,"" and popped open a fresh bottle of Castello, an Italian beer. He had me drink it, all the while espousing its comparative taste to Yuengling at a cheaper price point. It certainly tasted alright, and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what Yuengling was going for.

Since the Castello tasted fine, I ended up buying a case of it on Sam's recommendation. A few days later when I opened the box and drank a couple of the beers, however, I noticed that they tasted funny. That's when I looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its ""sell by"" date marked out in black Sharpie. You could see the numbers underneath the Sharpie, and the dates were for well over two years ago. So basically, Sam had convinced me to buy something he hadn't been able to sell, knowing that I lived in the East End and probably wasn't going to visit again anyway.

Stale beer aside, there's another big reason not to go to Caruso's: Their prices are steep--$24 for a case of Yuengling.

I don't expect every store to be cheap and carry good stuff like Trader Joe's, ergo I was never the one to oppose stores just because they're pricy. But this one is just pricy unjustifiably.

To shop here, you first have to get into the store, which means dodging bums and people selling EBT cards just outside the store. 

Once inside, you have to find a cart that has all 4 wheels, travels in a straight line, doesn't make squeeky noises, and isn't wet or filled with trash.

This store is not clean.

To its credit, they still have people who bag groceries for you, and the staff are decent, especially considering the demoralizing nature of their work environment. The location is also very good.

Despite being much smaller than most Giant Eagle stores, this one offers a decent selection of international foods, organic products, and vegetarian/vegan items.  I regularly buy produce here and see no difference between the quality/freshness of what this store offers and what other Giant Eagle stores sell.  The main difference in the produce section is, truly, the lack of dim, directional lighting that new and newly renovated stores use to give their produce that false garden-fresh glow.  Harsh overhead lighting doesn't create much of a mood, but at least I can see clearly enough to choose the freshest items.

The building itself is on the older side -- I'd guess it's probably about 100 years old.  The equipment, however, is pretty modern, and many of the rooms have been retrofitted for modern gym conveniences such as air conditioning.  

The Allegheny YMCA has the following features:
1) A room with cardio machines (some traditional elliptical trainers, some of the newer breed of elliptical trainers that are like a mating between a stair-stepper and an elliptical, rowing machines, and exercise bikes).  Most of the cardio machines are only about a year old and have those weird little TVs mounted on top, so you can see Barack Obama's mouth silently moving as you get your workout.
2) A basketball court with a track on top of it (28 laps = 1 mile).
3) A spinning studio.
4) A pretty decent weightlifting room, with a good balance between weight machines and free weights.  There's also a good range of free weights, so a weakling like me and a strong man like the dude I saw with biceps bigger than my waist can both use the weight room.
5) A pool that is not Olympic size, but is big enough to get in a decent workout by swimming lengths.
6) Secure access to the women's locker room (as well as to the fancy men's locker room).
7) A group exercise room.  Group exercise classes are included in the membership fee, and the instructors are really nice and also inspiring/motivating.  There's a good range of classes for all ages and fitness levels, including Pilates, yoga, water aerobics, spinning, and cardio kickboxing.

The membership fees are pretty reasonable here (a family membership for 2 adults and 2 children is $58/month plus a $125 joining fee), and if you are employed by UPMC, you get an additional discount.

Most importantly, the Allegheny YMCA is a very welcoming place, regardless of your age, gender, or current fitness level.  Gyms can be intimidating if you aren't in the greatest shape to begin with, and some gyms have members who aren't kind towards women who aren't super-fit or super-skinny.  But at the Allegheny Y, everyone I have met has been extremely friendly and nice to me, which is the best incentive to keep going to the gym.",0,Hm61vENWRqcAL_v6E3dD9Q,0,5,2009-01-20,review,0

The cardio room is still really, really good.  I've never had to wait for a machine, and the machines are quite nice and new still.  

The weightlifting room is also totally adequate, with pretty much a full complement of machines (older, but still serviceable), and a good assortment of free weights and related paraphernalia, including a Smith machine and a regular good ol' power cage.  There isn't any platform for Olympic lifts, and I haven't seen anyone in here perform them (there isn't a lot of room, so I'm not really sure how one would even go about powerlifting safely in this gym.)  However, there is a bucket of chalk in one corner.  Go figure.

The pool is fine if you aren't really hardcore into swimming.  If swimming is a major form of exercise for you, however, it might not be the best pool for your needs.  It's a four-lane pool, I think 25 yards long.  It is heavily chlorinated, and it tends to be QUITE warm, especially on Monday mornings (this is because kids with sickle-cell anemia use the pool on Sundays, and the water needs to be especially warm for them -- it hasn't cooled down yet by Monday.)

Steves is a great local dive for burgers and dogs. They are a great alternative to hospital food if you work at or are are visiting someone at Allegheny General Hospital. 

They offer burgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese, chicken and ham sandwiches, ,BLTs, kielbasa, fish sandwiches and fries. Burgers start at $1.00 and hot dogs start at 93 cents. You can add chili, sauerkraut, cheese and jalapenos to their hot dogs. There is a small counter to eat at but most people get their food to go.

Steve's also serves breakfast.

Manager embarrassed himself. Said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon. I told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didn't. then I said I used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no I didn;t and I had no idea what I was talking about. What an idiot! First rule of restaurant business is the customer is always right.

Then the food arrived. How hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms, seriously? It was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce. While the sauce did have some marsala in it, it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny. The Penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor.

I reply that it was just OK, that the food was good for the most part (he gave a shocked reply because I didn't say it was great) but that I was disturbed with the number of times the employees kept using the door to go outside to smoke. He seemed shocked to learn that that door was being used at all and said he'd put a stop to it. We said that we usually tip 100% on holiday meals like this since the workers have to give up a day with their family but that since the staff didn't seem to care as much about us, so we would not be doing 100% tip this time. I explained that we don't expect any kind of comp, but that he needed to know that his employees were making the dining room uncomfortable by using the emergency exit for their smoke breaks and social encounters. He said he was sorry for our experience and left the table. Our waitress eventually stopped by and we requested our pie packed to go.

Now, let's talk about when we reserved a room for a bridal shower...  We had a fixed menu for a group of about 50 ladies.  I understand that.  But when the bride asks for no tomatoes, you as a server do not say, ""No substitutions!"" in your meanest voice.  Lighten up, it's her day.  I ended up just taking the tomatoes off for her--and just chalked it up to another maid of honor duty.  The server also kept clearing the bride's drinks while she mingled.  This was annoying, but at least we had paid a flat fee for drinks, so it wasn't the hugest deal.

Overall, the server for the bride's table was just awful and kept treating us like little children.  Yes, the table was the bridal party and the bride's cousins.  Yes, we are all under 30.  But we are also young professionals and the ones who booked the event.  The servers who waited on the rest of the tables containing the mothers, aunts, great aunts, and grandmothers were polite...even when my near-senile grandmother started yelling about bandits.  Later, another server apologized on behalf of our bad server and mumbled that, ""he just must be on his period.""

2832,sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg,7eN85uYB3-Eb23jm4_CrYw,"Having lived near this Atria's location in the past, I can say that I've spent more than my fair share of time at the PNC Park Atria's. My wife and I stopped in this past week, and for me, I was reminded of why I enjoy Atria's...but this having been our first time at Atria's together, and witnessing my wife's experience, I realized why the place could garner such low reviews.

For someone like myself, who's actually had enough positive and negative food experiences at Atria's to know exactly what to order and what to steer clear of, I can make the experience a positive one, but that's a situation I'm afforded now thanks to my previous patience and convenience. My wife, opting to stray from my suggestions had an awful dinner. Her plate of bland fish and asparagus left her turned off completely. Luckily, we were using a gift card, so it wasn't as frustrating for her as it could've been. Regardless, walking away from an entire plate of food is disheartening.

That led me to realize this: If you're only at Atria's once, you're odds aren't that great of having a good experience. That's just the reality of the situation. There are a handful of really good things on the menu that I LOVE. The parmesan crusted chicken is really good, although it can sometimes be a little too oily. The pot roast is excellent, but it's way too heavy for most of the year...ESPECIALLY during baseball season when they're busier. Their chili is really on-point...especially paired with their bread, and the salmon salad is excellent. Although, I don't like the salmon, so I swap the salmon for chicken for a great salad option. The carrot cake is insanely good, but truth be told, it's not homemade. I could care less, though, as it's still some of the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. Period. Other notable items are the pot roast nachos, crab cakes, red skin smashed potatoes, and the reuben.

That's really where the positives end, though. I've learned to steer clear of the burgers because of the inconsistency with which they're prepared. I've received more undercooked burgers at Atria's than any other restaurant, and it's just not worth the gamble anymore. My filets have always been perfectly-prepared, but the one time I got a strip it was practically burned on one side and undercooked on the other. Failing to cook burgers and steaks correctly isn't that surprising, but deciding to serve them to customers despite their incorrect preparation IS surprising...and poor.

I know that the last time I had salmon on my salad, the fish tasted ""off"" and I paid the price for it later. I've never given a single fish meal a chance there since (we're talking years now). Hence, my request for chicken on my salads now. Most of the meals that I've had are average, and I've practically tried the entirety of the menu over the years, so believe me when I say it.

Why do I continue to go? Well, because the few items that I do love, are crave-worthy, and having become a regular (less so, nowadays), the service that I received at the bar was always excellent. Daniel and Roy have always provided  great service to me, and good service goes the distance, as far I'm concerned, so it's been worth stopping in from time-to-time. Unfortunately, if I can't sit at the bar, I don't always stick around, as the service at the tables is really hit-or-miss. For every good server they have, they have two more that could care less about their jobs...especially during peak times.

Regardless, this is my favorite Atria's location, because it's the least ""stuffy"" and pretentious location of them all, but there's still a lot of room to improve...and I hope it does.",1,Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw,1,3,2012-03-26,review,1

We stopped going for years because by that time Pittsburgh was in a restaurant boom. The Cheesecake Factory, McCormick & Schmick's and a lot of other similar restaurants had opened.

I recently started going back to Atria's when a co worker decided to treat me to lunch since it's near my office. The great food and service is back! The burgers are excellent! I highly recommend the crab cakes, they are second best behind Monterey Bay. I love the Sherry Crab Bisque and the Pot Roast Nachos appetizer are a must try! 

I just went for a Christmas work lunch and everything was perfect. We had ten people and everyone loved their food. Everyone got something different, burgers, steaks seafood, salads and sandwiches. The service was excellent. All of our glasses were refilled constantly before they ever got even half way empty.

They serve a mean crab bisque. It was deliciously creamy, quite generous with the crab meat and very filling without that nasty sick after-feeling. The coconut shrimp (with a nice crunchy, coconut-y breading) was also very tasty, and the portion was satisfyingly large for an app! The house salad was just a typical salad of iceberg and romaine lettuce drenched in shredded cheddar cheese and sprinkled with a few other veggies. Nothing special.  Just a random quirk I noticed:  for being a rather classy restaurant, I was surprised that they didn't add a slice of lemon to my glass of water (though I'm sure you could ask for it).

Maybe it's just the built in crowd. You come to a game, you gotta eat, right? And what are you going to eat? Either at a restaurant outside the stadium or inside. At this point I'd stick with inside for the novelty of it all. 

I stopped into Atria's on game day, but came in right as the first pitch was going out, so it wasn't packed in the least. Our server was obviously not into us, as well as serving that day, as she was pretty short with us the entire time. Sorry we bothered you...

The menu is incredibly limited with around 5 apps, 5 sandwiches and 5 main courses. I get that they're probably just limiting things for the crowded times, but I felt like nothing really called to me. I settled on going halfies and ordering an app and waiting until I was inside the stadium to get my ""main course."" Crab fries, naturally. But that's beside the point.

i will point out the good parts of the night first. we arrived to see a band play. the entertainment was great, didn't cost extra (although there was a $20 minimum per person), and i liked the set up in the room where they played. also, the soup i got (crab bisque) was delicious!
ok, now, for the rest of the experience. first of all, our service was AWFUL. i don't know our server's name, and i know some of the wait wasn't his fault, as there was a large party upstairs. but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks, another 15 before we even got them. ten more minutes before we could order our food, and after the meal, we must have waited at least 15 if not 20 minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain. i saw him checking on other tables, and it didn't seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy. as a server, myself, i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt, but it really got to be too much. the one thing i will say for him though, was that he was very nice. but for how much we waited, we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology BEFORE we had to complain.
the rest of the food and drinks were okay. good, but not enough to make up for the service. i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eat.

I went with a small group, and we filled ourselves silly on ribs and sides. 
Very good sauces. The small plate of ribs is *very* filling for lunch. 

As others have said, the decor is nothing to write home about. But there are a few tables. Most of the business when we were there was take-out, which I will definitely be returning to do.",0,Z0OGW8PysysRXE0dR7QxQQ,0,4,2011-12-17,review,2

Wilson's is what a great BBQ place should be.  Simple. 

There is no sense in overanalyzing what Mr. Wilson has been doing here for years.  He's not a competition circuit smoker, not a modern restaurateur spreading his seed across Pittsburgh, and certainly no hipster chef serving ingredients grown in his rooftop garden.

Ribs. Chicken. Sauce.

The slow smoked spare ribs, sold by the plate size or full rack, are smoked just long enough to make the rib bones protrude from the top of the slab but not long enough so the meat is ""falling off the bone""... tender and juicy, but enough bite to let you know that you're eating the flesh off an animal.  The color and texture of the surface aren't overwhelming in flavor but give you just enough crust and seasoning to let you experience the strata of bark / meat / fat.  For those that don't like fat, you'll complain about the ribs.  Spares have a tendency to hold a bit more fat within the meat fibers, particularly the section around the tips that are usually trimmed for a St. Louis cut.  you want low fat? Eat a pork loin or a handful of grass.

The chickens are halved and smoked right alongside the ribs. The skin had nice chew, a good simple rub, and cooked beyond the point of any gummy texture but not so long that it was a layer of armor surrounding the meat.  The dark meat was succulent and the white meat maintained just the right amount of moisture.

As requested, everything was served with the hot BBQ sauce.  Not mind blowingly hot, but a well rounded picquant flavor with a bit of black pepper on the tip of the tongue.  Tomato base with a bit of vinegar, good enough to compliment the meat and fat of both animals.

As for sides, the collard greens are tender and you'll come across the occasional gold nugget of pork.  The coleslaw and macaroni salad are simple and a bit underseasoned, but when eaten in tandem with the meat and sauce they compliment everything just fine.  Mr. Wilson also caps off an order with the true stamp of great bbq... white bread. A vessel to mop up all the rib shrapnel swimming in the pool of sauce at the bottom of your styrofoam container.

It's not the cleanest, it's not the classiest... why?  It's a rib shack in an old house that's been here for going on 53 years.  It may not be the best barbecue you'll ever eat, but in a city with new restaurants popping up every week that all try to outduel each other with trendy ingredients, it's nice to know that I can walk in through an old screen door and be slapped in the face with a stiff breeze of smoking pork... without having to worry about anyone selling me small portion size, extravagant presentation, and a list of 35 ingredients to compose a single dish.",0,Z0OGW8PysysRXE0dR7QxQQ,1,3,2013-02-28,review,5

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home.

So I did some research and quickly certain teams dropped the list of potential favorites. Besides that I had to get used to the game in all it's aspects. It was a search that took over 4 years looking, checking and searching for that feeling that your team is suppose to give you when they play. That feeling of pain, anger and lost when your team leaves the field defeated, or the feeling of joy, full Ecstasy and invisibility when the team beats it's opponent. 

Well it happened in 2004 after almost 5 years of learning the game, researching the teams and most important falling in love with FOOTBALL. It happened in 2004 in Roethlisberger's Rookie Year, I realized the Steelers where a team after my heart. My favorite (43) Polamalu (USC Baby!), like a 'heat seeking missile' going after anything that's getting to close to putting a number on the board. Big Ben a QB that is not afraid to get hurt or hurt you when necessary. 
Willy Parker, always smiling Ward (even when it hurts), the Bus, Harrison (watch out now!), Santonio Holmes, Tomlin (Yes We Can) and all the others that made Steeler FOOTBALL part of my life. 

I did not only fall in love with the STEELERS as a team, but also the history of this great team was an important factor. I am still growing in knowledge concerning the game, and becoming more and more familiar with the past and present of the Steelers, but one thing I know for now and for the future; ""I AM A STEELER FAN!""

2947,CidOqoyJeeSzeVF7iJB_8Q,vBkMCKZXHCn4y8G_q5WAHw,"Steelers nation - let's debrief.
 
The Packers won. straight out.
The Steeler's secondary was continually compromised by Aaron Rodgers and their spread-receiving corps. In my estimation, there were only 4 offenses in the league that could have exposed the Steeler's 1st overall scoring defense this year - the Packers (obviously), the Saints, the Patriots, and the Eagles.
The Steeler's offense was plagued by poor quarterback play. As much as I had defended Ben as the best quarterback in the league for this team, his deficiencies created a deficit that proved to be insurmountable. He had faced some of the league's best defenses and had not given up 2 interceptions all season, which leads me to believe the Pack was the only team in the league capable of shutting down the Steeler's offense so effectively, even with key injuries to their secondary.
 
In retrospect, I think the Steelers should have pursued a trade for the first overall draft pick (aka Sam Bradford) for Ben Roethlisberger a bit more aggressively, although the draft picks we had kept by not doing so represent a lot of potential for upcoming years. I think it's very clear that the first priority for the Steelers in next year's draft is at cornerback (even with rookie Crezdon Butler's eventual return), and the secondary will need to improve significantly next year after being so exposed this year in order to be in playoff contention again. To this, I'd have to recommend for the second straight year that #22 William Gay be cut immediately, as he has continually shown that he can not answer the bell and play to the Steelers' standard.
 
All in all, it was a good year - with the loss of so many offensive linemen and Aaron Smith to injury, I wouldn't have expected more than a Wild Card berth and possibly a playoff win. 3 rookies had shown significant potential with 3 others being groomed for future stardom, while reacquiring veteran ex-Steelers had a nominal impact on the field (but whose locker room presence may have been more valuable). Getting to the super bowl this year was a bittersweet surprise, which will give the team valuable experience as veteran leaders may potentially leave after this season.",2,5GS5sBSscgcex0IFTDL9Bg,2,5,2011-02-06,review,2

Founded in 1933 by Arthur J. Rooney, they were known as the Pittsburgh Pirates, later, given their own identity and renamed the ""Steelers"" in honor of Pittsburgh's steel industry. 

The first thirty-nine years were not kind to Art Rooney and the city of Pittsburgh, the Steelers could never put a winning season together, until, finally in 1972 Chuck Noll guided the team to their first divisional crown and playoff victory. It was on December 31st that perhaps the greatest play in NFL history took place when the ""Immaculate Reception"" propelled the Steelers to a victory over the Oakland Raiders. Instantly the city became a football town, with the Steelers winning four Super Bowls in six seasons.

No team has more Super Bowl victories (6) than the Steelers. Also, Chuck Noll is the winningest coach with four Super Bowl crowns. Bill Cower and present head coach Mike Tomlin also have Super Bowl victories. 

Notable Steelers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, Jack Ham, ""Mean"" Joe Greene, Terry Bradshaw, founder Art ""The Chief"" Rooney, Chuck Noll, Mike Webster, Dan Rooney, Franco Harris, and many more. Steeler fans want the Hall of Fame to open a Steeler's wing to accommodate all of the players in the hall and future Hall of Famers.

 I have a 9 month old daughter and I was so looking forward to taking her to her very first Steeler game! Now, she is a very very good baby and in social situations I have been able to take her everywhere. She loves people and loves to take in new and exciting experiences. The point of this is that she would be well behaved, laughing at a Steelers game, and most likely clapping with rowdy fans not throwing a temper tantrum and disrupting the game for others. I would take her out if she was upset, believe me I get it!

I feel that The Steeler organization is trying to weed out the younger crowd by charging full price for a ticket and a seat that a baby can't even use. Most kid friendly places don't charge for Children 2 and under, that includes Aiirlines in the US, museums, fairs, Zoos, Concert Venues, Pitt games(at Heinz Field) Baseball games(PNC park), and many more less opulent businesses.  

As far as the Steelers are concerned even though your child won't be using a seat they have to buy a full price ticket. I asked about Club level seating and yes especially in the club. Which would be the best place to walk around and entertain a youngster if fussy. If you purchase non club seating then it doesn't matter where your baby sits if you have lower level seats. Getting 3 seats together can be much pricier than a pair and are harder to find. I asked why this was the policy and an unfriendly person told me that ""Steeler Policy states that gate operator is not incumbent to assess a childs age of 2 or under so they do not have the resources available for gate entry for people in line entering the stadium.""

Sorry but considering the Pirates allow free entry under 2 and offer discounted tickets for children under 2 if they want to participate in the activities for children's days. So NOT COOL STEELERS!",0,5GS5sBSscgcex0IFTDL9Bg,1,2,2013-08-20,review,4

The Bucs swept the Royals in interleague play this past weekend!  And okay, I was there for the second game, not the third.  But I took my dad to the game for an early Father's Day gift.  We had a wonderful time as the Pirates defeated the Royals 5-3.  And I'm watching the Pirates with guarded optimism here.  They're off to the same great start they were last year. An article in the paper said that they were playing small ball, which must eman they're working on the little things, the fundamentals.  

Now let's see if we can keep the momentum going for the rest of the season and finish with at least a winning record for a chiange.  Oh well, at least with the Chicago Cubs sucking so badly we won't be in the cellar.",1,fB7XYJYrTtchlTmzSQVMbQ,1,3,2012-06-11,review,1

2973,iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA,il2_VZrOfaOGWdoKOexafg,"Ugh!  Another losing season.  WTF man, weren't we in first place at the All-Star Break?  What happened?  I wasn't expecting a World Series Champ or even a Pennant winner.  But was a winning season too much to ask for?  This marks the 20th anniversary since the Pirates' last winning season.  That's right folks--it's been since 1992.  Let's take a look at the world of 1992.

BASEBALL:  The Pirates' roster that year included Stan Belinda, Doug Drabek, Zane Smith, Denny Neagle, Jay Bell, Orlando Merced, Andy Van Slyke, and of course Barry Bonds.  All have since retired.  The only new ballparks were New Comiskey Park (now U.S. Cellular Field) and Camden Yards.  No stadiums had corporate names.  The Arizona Diamondbacks, the Colorado Rockies, the Miami Marlins, and the Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays didn't exist.  The Washington Nationals were the Montreal Expos.  The Milwaukee Brewers were in the AL.  Both the NL and the AL only had two divisions each.  The minor league Washington Wild Things didn't exist either and nor did their league.  KBL was the big cable sports channel.

TV:  ""Saturday NIght Live's"" cast included Dana Carvey, Ellen Cleghorne, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Mike Myers, Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman,  Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and David Spade.  ""Seinfeld"" hadn't become a huge hit yet and no one knew Kramer's first name.  Monday nights on NBC included ""Murphy Brown"", ""Evening Shade"" and "" Northern Exposure"".

MOVIES:  The top movies included ""Lethal Weapon 3"", ""Basic Instinct"", ""Hone Alone 2"", ""The Bodyguard"" and ""Aladdin"".  When you wanted to watch movies at home, you had to rent them from the video store and you watched them on VHS tapes or laserdiscs.  

MUSIC:  Bruce Springsteen released ""Lucky Town"" and ""Human Touch""  on the same day.  R.E.M. had ""Automatic for the People"".  Gin Blossoms released their first album ""New Miserable Experience"", which stayed on the charts for almost two years.  Bare Naked Ladies ""Gordon"" featured the cult classic ""If I Had a Million Dollars.""  You either listened to albums on cassette or CD and you bought them at record stores like National Record Mart.  Doug Hopkins (Gin Blossoms), Kurt Cobain (Nirvana), Shannon Hoon (Bline Melon) and Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead) were all alive.

TECHNOLOGY:  Few people had internet access.  You also used pay phones because you didn't have a cell phone.  You watched movies on a VCR.  You met up with your friends without texting them.  You ordered merchandise by ""sending in"" or by calling an ""800"" number.  You had to buy tickets by waiting in line.  

And OJ Simpson was still a football hero.

So that's it, Pittsburgh Pirates.  I feel like telling you I'm done with you guys.  I'm no fair weather fan, but 20+ years of losing is enough.",2,fB7XYJYrTtchlTmzSQVMbQ,2,1,2012-10-02,review,2

2975,2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg,j_xydMrB-lLF4oq3JpS4oA,"The Pittsburgh Pirates just had their first winning season in twenty years.  They made the playoffs and got Pittsburgh excited for baseball again.  So what would you rate the pirates front offices right now?  Are the pirates going to be in the pennant race for years to come or will they be one and done? 
                Neil Huntington became the Pittsburgh Pirates general manager 6 years ago.  Their minor league system ranked near the bottom half of the MLB when he first started.  Now they are rated in the top three minor league systems in all of baseball.  
                Neil has done a great job drafting the best players available in the MLB amateur drafts in his tenure.  His first pick was Pedro Alvarez.  The first Manager that he hired was John Russell.  I think that was a terrible hire but I do know what Neil was thinking.  The Pirates were not going to contend for the next three years at least.  So they just wanted to get a guy in there that would do what they wanted and try to teach their young players baseball and keep them motivated.  They soon fired Russell and made a terrific hire in Clint hurdle.  In the coming years in the draft the Pirates drafted Jamison Taillon, Tony Sanchez, and Gerit Cole.  Three of these draftees are significant parts of the major league team right now.  Tallion will join the Pirates by mid season this year.  I give the Pirates a grade A in drafting in these last 6 years.  Before 2008, Pirates management would draft the player who they could sign the easiest and not the best player available.  Now by drafting the best players available they have made their minor league system and their major league team one of the best in the majors.
                Another big factor in the team's most recent success and their future is their international signings.  Before Neil Huntington and Pirates owner Bob Nutting there were no Pirates facilities in Latin America.  That was a huge piece the Pirates were missing.  Roberto Clemente is from the Dominican Republic and all of the DR Players were going to other teams and not the Pirates.  The Pirates built a brand new facility in the DR and now they have some impact players to help the Pirates now and into the future.  The biggest signing so far has been Starling Marte.  In 2004 the Pirates hired Renee gayo to be director of their Latin America baseball operations.  His first signee was Starling Marte and he signed him for a measly $100,000.  He is now one of the top left fielders in the game.  Gayo also signed the Pirates number one prospect Gregory Polanco for $150,000.  He should be in Pittsburgh by midsummer this year.  He has the potential to be better that Marte and MVP Andrew McCutchen.  The two signings and a multiple other signings are leading the pirates to a very successful short term and long term future.
                Overall I really like what I see from this Pirate team and management.  Yes I would have liked them to sign a few guys over the off season but I trust they know what they are doing.  They are relying heavily on their farm system to carry them through this year.  They might have to make a trade or two if this plan doesn't work but they have a good young core in Pittsburgh that should allow them to have another successful 2014 and for several years to come.",0,fB7XYJYrTtchlTmzSQVMbQ,0,4,2014-02-12,review,0

I went their complaining about a possible over heating and requesting a change of oil. This was my first visit there. They topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil. I had a check engine light on for which I knew the code and was holding off on repairing it. 

They charged me $20 for reading the check engine light code and turning it off. I didn't want that. I pointed this out on the bill and he said that, its fine, I can just pay for the oil change (~$42). He asked me if I had $42 cash on me. If I did, I could have paid and left a happy customer. But I didn't, so I gave him my card and he went in the back and swiped it for the full price ($42 + $20 + tax). When I was signing the transaction receipt, I told him that he swiped for the full price. This apparently pissed him off a lot, he very rudely handed $20 from his pocket and asked me to ""Get out of there"" - and walked out. I tried to talk to him and explain my reason of asking - it not being the matter of $20 but of the principle that he said he wasn't going to charge me for what I didn't want. But he wouldn't listen, was very rude and said ""You're Done"" and ""Get out"" more times. I left.

The seasoning was perfect, the cooking instructions they provided when I asked worked without a single hitch, and the beef was tender and juicy even when well-done (which is how I like my meat cooked).

They advertise their fresh Italian sausage (hot and sweet) - which is stocked new each Friday.  Also worth while is their ground beef (we easily go through a couple of lbs of ground beef a week between the two of us).  A slab of ribs will cook up tasty and tender on the grill, without needing to boil or marinade for hours. I have yet to try many of their other offerings - but I am sure I will at some point!

Also check out the hot dog and hamburger buns - they are fresh and delicious!!

Okay, so you know when you go into  place and it's close to closing time?  You aren't sure whether the staff will be cordial and inviting or straight up rude.  Well my wife and I went into Millers at 9:15 pm for dinner.  The hostess was incredibly rude directly off of the bat.  she said ""ughhhh you know it's close to closing time, right""?  my wife said, ""what time do you close""?  The older, short blond curly haired hostess with glasses said ""we close at ten"".  TEN???  TEN????  They weren't closing for 45 minutes!!!!  This was the second time she did this to us and it will be the last because they have lost our business for good.  We even heard a phone ring at quarter to ten and she didn't even answer the phone, she just picked it up and snarled ""closed"" and hung up on the person!  Our server however, was spot on and the food was decent but the hostess or manager or whatever she was left the worst taste in our moths and spoiled Millers Seafood forever.

I will start with the good. Service is pretty good.

The place smells of smoke. Why? Because you can smoke in the bar and there is an opening from the bar into the restaurant. This has to be a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in Pittsburgh. Gross. 

The floor (carpeted) is so old that it is sticky and worn down. Walking on it with shoes on disgusted me. The walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place. Please, remodel! At least make me feel like the place is clean. If I feel like it is dirty in the dining hall, I can't imagine it's clean in the kitchen.

Now for the food. I am pretty picky about seafood. It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me. Salmon that tastes overly fishy, to me, screams ""this fish is not fresh"". Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes. I get it, you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.

Overall, I just don't think this place is good, and don't want to go back.",1,YUZVBdGmagwXV-yOhR-1GQ,1,2,2011-12-30,review,3
3009,9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg,HGDJi52sqDsp0AFbSqqXpg,"After seeing a Google Offer for Miller's, my Mom mentioned how she had been there before and remembered good food and fond memories from her childhood.  So I offered to go with her and see if the food was still as good.  

Once we were seated and greeted by our waitress, we presented the paperwork for our Google Offer.  The waitress handed it to the hostess.  I guess they have to call for us to redeem it/verify that it's legit.  Well apparently one of the numbers was missing off the print-out and the hostess could not have been more rude about it.  In the end she talked to someone and figured it out, but she made it seem like we did something wrong.  Or, she could have told us there was a problem but then politely taken care of it since it is her job and there wasn't much else going on for her to do.  Or she could have talked to someone in the first place and quietly resolved the matter without us even knowing there was a problem to begin with.  I later noticed signs up all over the place about restrictions with restaurant.com offers - I guess they have several patrons who use those regularly.  Apparently with this kind of reception, no one wants to pay full price.

Mom and I both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese.  The mac n cheese was creamy and the fish sandwich was a large portion and very tasty.  I ended up having to eat mine with a knife and fork, not even attempting to lift and eat it as a sandwich.  We left with full and happy tummies.

To comment on previous reviews....yes, this is not the cleanest place.  But I expected that and find it part of the charm.  The smoke from the bar is no longer an issue as a closed door separates the bar area from the dining room.

Overall, it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich.  I'd like to give it 3 stars at least, but the whole attitude from the hostess still left a bad taste in my mouth that the mac n cheese couldn't wash away.",1,YUZVBdGmagwXV-yOhR-1GQ,2,2,2012-07-04,review,2

The waitress was good.  I think she knew we weren't all that pleased with our food even though we told her it was good.

The food....my daughter-in-law had the shrimp scampi.  We are pros at making our own at home, but when it was served, I told her that there are variations to it.  Her first bite she made a sour face.  My son and I then tasted it...understood the face after that.  Way too much lemon juice in it, soaked in oil and not quite sure what the seasoning was, but seemed like pesto.  The pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there. 

My son and I had the fried seafood platter.  Aside from overcooked breading and soaked in grease, the oysters were raw, and the battered fish had no flavor.  The breaded shrimp tasted weird too.  Needless to say, none of us finished our food. Underneath the food, the plate had a puddle of grease. 

On the upside, the coleslaw, bread, and crab cake was good.  The make and cheese was edible, but seemed to comparable to Stauffer's.

All of the doughnuts:  Raised or cake, cream or jelly, chocolate or vanilla, they're ALL SO GOOD.  I wish I could stop and say no.  But I just can't.  The selection here doesn't go too fast.  I can usually still get one around lunch time, but if you want options, go early.

Lemon Poppyseed Muffin:  They run out quick, but they're so yummy!  It usually triumphs over the doughnuts.

Thumbprint cookies:  Maybe I just love the cookie, but I really like them here too!

Luckily I had also found additional information to refute those articles.  Why lucky, you ask?  Because this is a great little office nestled off the main drag in Dormont.  Yeah, it's a bit of a drive from Pittsburgh proper, but they are also open later to help with the fact that some of us actually work for a living.

It is a very small waiting room and you really don't want to have to wait due to the different animals that are continually coming through the door -- that is vet common sense -- so make certain you call ahead to get an appointment.  All of the associates were well mannered and fawned over my little Sophie.  All of the paperwork was filled out for us and were were quickly taken back to one of the exam rooms.  Typical exam room with easily cleaned metal table and linoleum floors.

The Vet-Tech was very knowledgeable and seemed truly interested in making certain my puppy was taken care of.  A little preachy near the end, I let it slide knowing why she was saying it -- positive reinforcement for the puppies is the only way to go people, believe it.  The doctor came in soon after and did the full exam on Sophie.  He was quick and methodical, but at no time did I hear my pup whine.  He pointed out things that he saw and gave Sophie her preliminary vaccinations.  

And then all was done.  At no point did he try to up-sell me.  At no point did he or his associates try to give me anything that was not needed.  He was straightforward and plain in his language and he answered all of my questions truthfully.  How do I know?  I already knew the answers to my questions.  I am fairly protective of my Boston Terriers; and as a small breed they have some health idiosyncracies and nuances that many vets don't know about.  He knew the answers.   I was happy.  

At the end of the visit, they even gave me the records without hesitation.  This office is great.  I will definitely return when I am in the area.",4,titJ-ofqKMG9d0i9_kkX6A,2,5,2009-12-03,review,5

I had two rats and Dr. Dorn was excellent with both. He was the best vet I could have hoped for. 

With rats, it's sometimes hard to find (even highly experienced) vets who understand that a rat has a personality and bonds with its owner to the same degree as a dog--many people act like pet rats are just large gerbils. Dr. Dorn understood, and never made me feel silly about being anxious about them. He calmed my pets down and they loved him immediately, even falling asleep during the exam. He never tried to up-sell, and when one rat had an operable tumor (a $200 surgery) he didn't make me feel guilty for choosing euthanasia instead (he was a very old rat). When the time came, the entire staff was incredibly patient with me, and let me spend as much time as I needed in the private exam room with my rat. Afterwards, they even sent me a condolence card. 

The vet techs were all professional and cheerful. The small office seemed like a friendly, casual environment. Exams for a rat were around $60 with medicine and so forth... I can't remember the specific prices, but they seemed reasonable. They were always able to see me on the same day I called.

He canceled his order and we sat at the friendly place next door. Not only did Knossos lose my boyfriend's business that day, but they also lost both of us as future customers.

Yes, they are expensive but as the old saying goes, ""You get what you pay for"".  In particular, about 15 years ago, I purchased an outdoor furniture set called Winston (48"" round glass table, 4 ultra high back chairs, recliner and an ottoman).  These were the sling style. At the time it was hard to swallow the price but the sales rep promised me the quality was untouchable.  Well, the sales rep was right.  I have had some neighbors go through multiple sets of ""cheaper"" outdoor furniture over the years.  Well after 15 years, finally the fabric started to give as I and my girlfriend both broke through the fabric. My girlfriend wanted to throw them out and buy new from a big box store. I was tempted to do that but then decided to look into spray painting the very durable aluminum frames and buying replacement slings for them.  I am very handy and decided to install the new slings myself to save some money.  I ran into a couple of road blocks as it was not as straight forward as it might sound. I called the store and spoke to a Marcy who was very helpful.  Instead of pushing me away or trying to sell me new, she allowed me to speak to the tech who gave me a few suggestions.  The result is we now have absolutely beautiful outdoor furniture again that is as comfortable as it was 15 years ago.  They look brand new and we are really glad we took the effort to re-do them.  We never would have been able to do this with the ""cheaper"" furniture.  Thanks to Marcy, Tom and others at the Fireplace and Patio Place for being so helpful.  It made the initial price not so bad after all.  In fact if you do the math, these are now downright inexpensive if you divide the price paid by the number of years we go out of them.  So it does pay to buy good quality stuff and this store has plenty of good quality.

We also purchased a stainless steel TEC grill about 13 years ago and the same hold true for that. My friends laughed at me when they heard how much I paid for it but they have gone through many cheaper grills and mine still looks brand new.  I did have to replace a few parts and the glass cooking plate a few times but it still looks and operates as good as it did on day 1.

We also purchased a 2 different gas logs sets for our 2 fireplaces although we don't really use them much these days.  Maybe if the price of natural gas comes down we might use them more.",0,0sIumiRwbjhT71ltLIZqqQ,0,5,2013-09-21,review,0

After years of searching, I found a pendulum! I was so surprised to find the unassuming tiny metal acorn literally jump at me! I had assumed that what I needed would be an ornate crystal pendulum, but ""great things come in small packages"". After I took it home it took no time to get acquainted with it. 

The store contains many crystals, gems, jewelry, oils, and even jars of dried herbs. There were around 60 different bumper stickers to chooses from. And hard to find matchstick incense. It is exactly what you think, a match you strike that burns as incense. Speaking of which, I was disappointed to not find any ""pick your own"" incense sticks.

Kuhn's has absolutely surpassed Foodland. It's clean, has most everything I need and it's at the right price. I'm actually surprised how much variety they offer in such a ""small"" space. Small being the operative word, considering most Giant Eagle's are ginormous.

Kuhn's has somehow become the place we stop when we don't have time to drive to Giant Eagle. 

Which is totally a shame, because whenever I DO stop in here I'm reminded about how nice the place actually is. Today a simple trip for milk turned into a fall-themed decoration shopping spree that went really well (yay super cute owl pillows!) and I ended up picking some breakfast and lunch items as well just because of how cheap they were. I know from past experience that the produce is fresh, and between the wonderful aroma and colorful display the bakery here is absolutely torturous to pass. There's also a ready-made dinner/lunch shelf with sandwiches, chicken wings, pizzas and a few dessert items if you want to grab those on your way out; I've actually gotten dinner here a few times on my way home from the city when I was too tired to cook. What's not to like about affordable and delicious food, right?

However, there is at least one thing that does keep me from wanting to be a regular here and giving Kuhn's a 5 star review: the blasted parking lot you have to deal with to go here, which I've cursed in other reviews. This lot is the one that fills up super quickly, creates miniature traffic jams like no one's business, and is a time-stealing trap. Sigh.

Their prices are less expensive than GE too!  If only they had fuel perks...  The service is always fast and friendly.  I'll be doing the rest of my thanksgiving shopping there.

I don't need to walk halfway around the planet, or use GPS, to find what I need. The staff are ALWAYS helpful and friendly! Despite their modest size, they do stock a very wide range of products, meats, and produce-far more than any other grocery store of similar size. Also, Kuhn's started as a butcher shop waaaay back in the day, and the quality  and selection of their meats shows it-far better than any competitors. They are open 24 hours, and the deli is open til 10pm. The hot foods here are fantastic. I often just grab my dinner to go, while I'm shopping. And the rotisserie chickens are HUGE compared to other stores. I just wish the hot foods were open a bit longer-they shut down, and 6pm, when most people are just getting home from work. The baked goods are another plus. The cakes here actually taste like cake from a bakery. Not many grocery stores can make such a claim. Checking out at Kuhn's is also a breeze. They actually have plenty of staff on registers, so as to keep lines moving, and very short-unlike S&S and Big Bird. And there are none of those damned self check outs. If I'm giving a store my business, I shouldn't have to check myself out, because they are too cheap to properly staff the place (I'm talking to YOU Giant Eagle). In addition, the prices here typically LOWER than S&S and Big Bird. The only reason I can't give this place a full 5 stars, is that they often run out of basic products (dog food, deli meats, sale items), the early closing of hot foods, and the game of chicken one has to play when parking at Banksville Plaza. Still, Kuhn's is by far, the BEST grocer in the area.",0,9NL2GL4jSPVj9SKijH5PqA,0,4,2015-01-01,review,0

I have just recently moved to Beechview and the best part of moving to a new part of this wonderful city is giving new businesses a try! I have sampled so many tasty and amazing new food items and coffee drinks etc etc. I am always in search of a non-smoking bar where I can hang out, eat, drink, and get to know the locals. I prefer small bars with ""yinzers"" as they tend to be a true gauge of a neighborhood for me. 

We have many friends in this area, which means that we got some great tips before we even moved in about different types of food, stores, laundromats, and bars. One of these tips, repeated from friend to friend, was The Huddle. As the name implies it is a bar where you can be certain you can watch a sports game of whatever sport-ball type you're interested in. It is indeed non-smoking, a handful of tables suitable for 4 people and a ""U"" shaped bar right in the center as soon as you come in. It is a cash only establishment with an ATM on site for quick transactions. The have free popcorn from a popcorn machine which makes the place smell amazing. It's been around quite a while which means that there is a great group of locals who frequent the establishment. 

This is truly everything I need in a local bar. We had been in for the very first time for drinks shortly after moving in and happened to be in there on one of their two weekly wing nights. This are not the wee tiny wings, more a weird in between of some of the ""full"" size wings I've had other places that clearly came from giant monster mutant chickens (I mean maybe they were goose wings, who even knows... they were huge) and the teeny tiny wing night wings you find most other places. They have two options; buffalo (sloppy) and ""tanned"" which are buffalo then cooked again so they are drier and crisp and un-freaking-believeable. The prices are mega cheap and it's so filling and delicious we've been back more than once for them. I like this place so much we have even taken the handsome-boyfriend's mother there when she was in town for the weekend. (P.S. She loved it too!) 

My dear sweet lovely readers, here is where I have to talk about something less than all of the amazing parts I've already mentioned. Tonight, both ravenous from too little food and too much work-day, we trekked up the monster that is Coast Avenue for beers and food and a chill environment (that would undoubtably involve pre-season football). We walk in the door and aside from an employee (other than the bartender) and a few people in the back at tables, we are the only patrons aside from one regular. We belly up to the bar on the far side and say our hellos. This is where I get a serious case of the sad. The bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence. Ok, I get it... I work sort of indirectly with the public I have days where I can't handle people. It happens! As customers come in and sit down, she greets them with a warmth that was clearly lacking. Ok. That's sort of disappointing but still fine. When we got to the point that we asked for a menu three times while she retrieved menus and took orders for the people next to us an hour after we came in... thats where I start to have an issue with the service. Eventually we decided to leave because I was tipping over the line to ""hangry"" and was afraid I'd lose my temper after the 3rd time we had asked for menus and didn't get them while she continued to warmly greet other patrons and provide them menus and take their orders while refilling our beers seemed to be an annoyance to her to the point of not even asking if we wanted another or the same beer and just taking the glass and starting to fill it (wherein I had to stop her because I hadn't asked her for another one and actually just wanted the tab cashed out).

Yes, of course I'll give it another try, I want this to be my local hang out bar. My service in sitting at the table or being served by the woman I presume is the owner has been great.

Sushi Three has an extensive menu that seems to have expanded since the last time I visited, and has lots more than just sushi.  There is a long list of appetizers, tempuras and teriyaki dishes, and some Chinese offerings.  The main focus, the sushi, takes up a large portion of the menu, and there are many different rolls, ranging from the basic kappa rolls to the complex southside roll (shrimp, smoked eel, fish flakes, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, egg and caviar).  As a vegetarian, I appreciate the vegetable sushi platter, which I have never seen anywhere else and only costs $12.  There is even a separate vegetarian menu.

While I do appreciate the wide-ranging menu, I just can't like the atmosphere.  It's always very quiet and dark inside, and I always get the feeling of being in a cave.  I prefer to get take-out or delivery.

Our first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.

It was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was ""Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday."" WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say, we skipped dessert.

3126,DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA,oFhQm4gJ6hdv_sQN3PHuXw,"I am a huge fan of Sushi Three. They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.

Speaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I hate the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh. If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.

By the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes. But of course, a place with the word ""sushi"" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy.

I at this point have developed a routine order: a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls are all I need here. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me, but the truth is that Sushi Three makes such enormous orders that I can't eat more than that without feeling a bit sick. 

But hey, at least you get your money's worth! I say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan.",2,QnyzlVMyx0Exri-Lay10cA,2,5,2012-12-08,review,2

3155,DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA,_O_nosUGOaWKKkWLVQMPkw,"Tom's Diner is one of those places I really, really want to like. You see it when driving down the street and it looks like a cool, retro place that got picked up from the past and dropped in the present next to the chain stores and abandoned buildings lining the rest of the street. If only the experience here matched the charming exterior.

I don't have a problem with the diner food, first of all; it's not great, but hey, for cheap eats, it's not bad. They make a mean French onion soup, I admit. 

My problem is more with the maintenance of the place. The windows are dirty, seats are busted, tables aren't properly cleaned - those things really detract from the experience and make the place look run-down and a bit unwelcoming.

The biggest offense for me, though? The service. My waitress? It took her three trips to remember I had ordered an additional drink (yes, we reminded her), by which time I was almost done with my meal. Also: this diner does not have ketchup at its tables. This would be okay if the servers remembered to bring it out with all meals. They do not. 

Seriously, guys: you operate in Pittsburgh. Ketchup is mandatory.

I may poke in for a quick bite again, but I'll be honest with my final opinion: considering how mediocre my experience was on a slow Saturday night, I suspect some fast food chains could knock Tom's out of the park on a busy day at this diner.",1,m61vZsAxmTEq3uiCjFjM8Q,2,2,2012-12-08,review,2

3159,rBLM0bkvk3PfJTG8vkynOQ,yIHQsIORMl7-r8Jq_CHsfA,"Located within a short walk of the hotel my girlfriend and I were staying at while visiting Pittsburgh, Tom's came up as one of the must visit options near us, especially for our pre-tourism breakfasts.

The restaurant has a very old school diner shtick with old, cracked vinyl booths, and a red and white motif. It was almost empty when we arrived for a relatively late breakfast, missing out on the commuter crowd. A friendly Greek lady who may have been one of the owners served us promptly and we were perusing the plentiful options before us.

I decided to go with the gyro breakfast burrito which comes with eggs, gyro meat, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms in a crisp griddled tortilla, and slices of fried potatoes on the side as well as gyro sauce, aka tzatziki. The meat in the burrito was crisp and gravitating towards the dry side of the moisture spectrum, but it had a really good flavour, quite similar to donairs here in Halifax. Although the crisp tortilla added a nice texture to the dish, I would have preferred a soft pita for the sake of being able to eat it with my hands.

The potatoes were OK at best. Some pieces had nice crisp edges, but their texture was inconsistent and a normal hashbrown or home fry would have been better.

If I was around for longer, I'd have definitely tried Tom's again, but alas, it'll always be Dor-Stop that holds a place in my heart.",0,m61vZsAxmTEq3uiCjFjM8Q,0,3,2014-07-15,review,1

3162,UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA,7JWyzsa3KrDUNmb_LpEhNQ,"I have to say I really loved this place.  I love the mesh of old and new.  I love a greasy spoon.  Most of all, I love the fact that I can visit here any time of the day.

I have heard of Tom's for a very long time.  I remember there being a Tom's in the South Side and visiting it many times, but this spot is so different.  There's a different vibe here, more laid back, less bustle.  Walking in here makes you feel as if you are entering a tiny road stop diner, you kind of forget that you are still within the Pittsburgh region, especially if you stop here in the wee hours of the morning.

I grabbed a booth to myself and within a minute the waitress was there to hand me a menu and ask me what I wanted to drink.  Looking over the menu took me some time seeing how this was my first visit here.  I ended up ordering a BLT with a side of loaded fries.  While waiting for my food to arrive I looked around the place and took it all in.  The colors, decor, and furniture definitely give you that diner vibe.  When I think of a diner I think of the shiny chrome, the bright white and red checkered pattern and bar stools at a counter.  All of that is here!

My food finally arrived and I started to dive into it.  The first thing that popped into my head was, ""why did I order a side of fries?""  The BLT comes with a decent side portion of fries to begin with, I really didn't need more fries.  The BLT itself was perfect.  The bacon was greasy, yet crisp, the lettuce was refreshing and the tomato was just the right thickness.  Add a little mayo to the toasted bread and we are in business.  It was so good I wish I had just ordered two BLTs.  The loaded fries were pretty good as well.  Topped with cheese sauce and bacon (man, I just couldn't get enough of that bacon).

The waitress on duty was super polite and very attentive.  Even though it was very early in the morning, she did not miss a beat or sit around.  The only gripe I have about this place is the prices.  Some of them need to be readjusted, but other than that, it's a stellar place to get a meal.

Incongruously, for no apparent reason, they were also selling a shelf full of bananas in plastic bags (um, OK?) and they sell bottled drinks and coffee too, but they force you to use styrofoam cups for the coffee-- I would suggest reusable mugs be allowed, or something else more environmentally sound.

Counter help and girl on phone were polite but could speak up a little more. Their preprinted order slips indicate a space for ""salesgirl"" to sign, instead of ""salesperson"" so I'd suggest  a change on that.

That's OK with me but if you add the magic word ""baked"" as in ""I'll have three cuts pepperoni baked"" they will put the toppings on and put the pizza back in the oven until it melts.  It is still awesome.

the italian sub is also great.  Ask them to add pepperoni, it's worth it.  I've been going there since 1994 and am indebted to the guy that took me there for lunch. If you think it is a dive now, you should have seen it then.

I went with a born & raised Pittsburghian who hasn't lived in the 'burgh for a decade.  He had fond memories of this place so late one night we set out for Beto's.  He was surprised to find that the place is now housed in a fairly new upgraded building giving off a somewhat upscale vibe.

Even though it was after midnight, they were still serving take out... so hooray for their late night hours.  We orders some ""cuts"" (Pittsburgh's way of saying ""slices"") to go and ate them in our car in the parking lot.

For the former Pittsburgher, the place may have changed, but the pizza tasted just as he remembered.  Tangy sauce, cuts in rectangular shape, crust was bready but had some crunch on its underside.  The unique thing about this pizza is they take it out of the oven and then add the cheese... and alot of it.... so its not altogether melted when you eat it.  My friend loved it.

To me it was unique but just okay.  I like a thinner crust, cheese melted and cooked all the way through, crust less bready.

I remember that crusty bottom crust, the simple sauce of just tomatoes, the cool cheese on the top, and gooey cheese closer to the hot crust. This is a unique pizza. You get crunchy, chewy, warm, and cool in each bite. Now if you take it home the cheese will melt,(by the way this is the best cold breakfast pizza you'll ever have!) but if you do like locals do, you'll eat it there and enjoy it the way it's supposed to be eaten. The bread fresh from the oven, cold, full fat mozzarella spread on top.

Ok, so they DO have a slightly different take, throwing the cold shredded cheese onto the pie as soon as the dough is out of the oven. This does not melt the cheese, and I do see how the pizza would be cold after heaping on the cheese.  Some customers may like it, me, not so much. I tried the Italian hoagie.  It was a good size and the meat was flavorful. But that's about it. They put oil on the sandwich, but no other dressing. I expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed. My date ordered a hot sausage hoagie. I didn't sample it, he liked it, but it was way too messy. The bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart. It looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich.  The staff did seem pretty nice, even trying to keep a smile while dealing with the stress of a busy crowded restaurant.

I forgot to tell her, nay, I purposely didn't tell her about the cheese because I knew she'd turn her nose up at it because the idea of cheese not melted on a pizza would surely upset the planets and cause disruption in the space/time continuem. But it backfired on me and the one thing I didn't expect was her to order extra cheese. 

We sat down and I explained to her the total stupidity of ordering a large drink in a place that offers free refills. Order a small, it's way cheaper and this really sounds like a scene that could have played out on an episode of Seinfeld.

Pizza time! The look on her face was one of shock, like mine when I realized that America was indeed stupid enough to elect George Bust for a second term. The cheese was piled high, and no visible evidence of anything under this massive mass of diary goodness. Like a trooper she picked up a slice and dived in. She liked it!

First, they sell pizza by the square slice ( which isn't so unorthodox, I know) and second their pizza comes out with the cheese uncooked on top of the hot crust, along with any other toppings you might fancy.

My first imprecision, ""Damn, they didn't cook my pie!"" I have heard a lot about this pizza but know one has ever said anything about a ""Raw"": slice of pizza! But to no avail, it was an illusion. It seems as if they cook there pizza and then top it with the toppings....? Strange..? Well, yes it is strange to this jedi, but Beto's knows what they are doing! 

The crust is in word, umm, ahhh, AWESOME! Nice and crunhcy, light and flaky, and also has the moistness of a biscuit.......if that makes any sense. Sauce is also good, nothing crazy, just good ole pizza sauce. The sauce reminds me of Kiddyland Pizza at Kennywood, or it has the feel of Della Sala's Pizza (Verona). 

I went with my favorite pizza combination, Mushroom & Onion. I was excited because they use canned mushrooms and loaded them on. Call me weird, but i love canned mushroom on my pizza. Another delight, the onion was sliced into rings. Onions HAVE to be sliced into rings for pie....plain an simple. Diced? One pissed of jedi! Like I said before, raw toppings, so it was a shock to bite into raw cheese and onion. The raw onion went well with the whole Beto's thing they have going on. I was pleased.

I will be back to Beto's and it is a great change of pace. I do not know if it is blaspheme to order the pie ""double cooked"", but I would like to try that. It would definitely be a knife & fork pie.

They cook the pizza without the cheese and when it comes out of the oven, they put the cold cheese and toppings on the pizza.

Also, the sauce has huge tomato chunks in it, unless you ask for it without.

As far as the actual restaurant, they made a major upgrade a few years ago and it is much more accommodating than it was before. Prior to the renovations, it was tiny with a few small booths and very little standing room.

No explaination of anything. 50 cents per slice for every topping? Well yeah we got 14 slices, so do the math. NOT a medium. Boxed up horribly, so on our 3 minute ride home, the box was leaking grease out of the corner. I was so upset over spending nearly $40 on something that I thought would be cheap and easy, I couldn't even enjoy the pizza. Its just whatever pizza anyway. 

Save your money and go to Slice on Broadway. 1/3 of the price,  staff is wonderful,  and they have a liquor license and fair prices. Slice should get half the publicity this place gets.

 I'm sure you have gathered that this pizza is kind of presented exactly like frozen pizza from the store except the bread is cooked. I think the appeal to this place is that it is different - Some people go to restaurants where you can cook your own food because it's different but the fact of the matter is that when I go out to eat, I don't expect to cook it myself and I don't expect it to come half cooked. 

Had this pizza been cooked, I feel like it would be subpar. The crust was very crispy and the sauce was a standard tomato (no extra hints of basil or pepper). The peperoni reminded me of the peperoni that comes in Lunchables - actually the whole pizza reminded me of a Lunchable (except a pie made of 28 cuts is $35.28 with $.50 per topping a CUT!) To be fair, each cut is $1.30 and you only need 3-4 to really, really be full.  They really lay on the toppings - about an inch of cheese, 20 slices of peperoni and a handful of banana peppers for just two cuts with toppings
. 
I feel that you really need to be in the mood for Betos before you go there. When I am in the mood for pizza, I am heading for the flowing, stringy cheese and the flavors melting together before it hits my mouth. I would eat here again if I get the craving - some people in the restaurant had ordered other menu items that looked to be pretty good. I wouldn't take somewhere here as a Pittsburgh Destination though.

I understand the polarizing nature of a Beto's style pizza, but we definitely have established ourselves at the far THUMBS UP end of the spectrum.

By not cooking the pizza with the toppings, it preserves the fantastic crust, by not allowing the oil from melted cheese to make it soft and gooey.  Instead the crust remains fresh, firm and flavorful.  They sauce is deliciously fresh and tangy, with lots of nice chunks of tomato.  And the toppings, we get either just cheese or cheese/pepperoni and generous and delicious.

Yes, I called them and asked for a price on ordering a case of import beer.  When they called me back with the price, I decilned purchase.  I was talking at the same time to another distributor who was doing a lot more leg work for me tracking down the supply chain.  When he informed me he could have a case shipped to wherever I bought my beer, I gave him Banksville Beer's name thinking I was giving them some extra business.  I don't normally get my beer from there.  When I stopped into Banksville to pick it up, a person who I assume was the owner got immediately defensive with me, raised his voice saying ""You told me you didn't want it.""  I tried to explain what had happened, but he continuously interupted me with a constantly rising voice level barely allowing me to get a word in.  He claimed he did not speak to the guy I had spoken to, which was obviously a lie since he referred specifically to ""that person you (meaning me) talked to.""  I finally had to cut him off and say, ""Listen, do you have the case here or not?""  He said they did not, so I left.

I can understand his frustration if what I did caused him any loss or inconveneince, but he did not need to take the majorly unprofessional approach that he did.  I honestly had no idea that I did anything wrong, and on the contrary thought I had actually done them a favor.  Had he explained the circumstance, it would have been no harm, no foul and lesson learned.  And I just would have asked them to order me a case straight out and would have returned for more cases to be orderd in the future.  But because of that reaction, I will NEVER step foot in there again under any circumstance.

3266,DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA,yzKbERyeK-jVVncQ9f1XPA,"Banksville Beer is one of those places I very rarely have to shop at; I don't drink a ton of beer and given a choice between cider (which you can get here) and wine (not so much, obviously), wine will usually win. 

As a result, one stop here can keep my cider/beer supply stocked for months. Now, while I've never left the shop empty handed and I LOVE browsing the fantastic and varied beer selection here, I have admittedly had trouble finding specific favorite beverages of mine, such as flavors of Magner or even varieties of Blue Moon. But I think this has more to do with my taste (remember, not the biggest beer person, more of a cider/wine person) than the shop itself - you can always at least find the basic ciders and beers here. And again, I've never left empty handed despite my snobby tastes: usually I leave with a whole case of Woodchuck, and most recently a whole case of Fall Woodchuck. Yum! Also, the men behind the desk are usually pretty good about asking if you need a hand taking things to your car. (Usually.)

Still, the parking situation here keeps me from giving the place 4 stars. Getting into the lot here can be a little frightening as you hope the person behind you is paying attention and slowing down while you turn into the lot. The lot itself is pretty tiny so problems can arise if too many people stop in for beer at once. Finally, getting out is even more terrifying than pulling in, because no one slows down on Banksville, ever, to let you out. Be prepared to sit for a few minutes if traffic is heavy.

Fried zucchini ($5-6) is listed as an appetizer, but is enough for a meal, and comes from a local farm in Butler.  The freshness really shows in the taste.

Our relationship started at 16 years old.  It was my first job and continued to supplement my burgeoning shopping addiction throughout High School and into College.  I had a fantastic time throwing people's menus down as a hostess and then filling food orders (and occasionally spilling orange juice on people's crotches, oops) as a waitress and gossiping with my coworkers.  So needless to say, I have a special place in my heart for this lovely establishment!

I think for a Pittsburgh owned chain restaurant it's one of the best.  This is in terms of how the business is run and the restaurants itself.  My love affair of grilled stickies began here.  I may have occasionally shoved one or two in my mouth as soon as they came out of the oven.  I also can't resist a smiley cookie.  They seem to be at every event in the city, so I never have to go long to fulfill on my smiley cookie cravings.  Thank gawd!

My all time favorite salad is the grilled chicken and portabella salad.  I absolutely love the balsamic dressing and mix of fresh ingredients.  I also had a second in High School (when I didn't have to count so many calories, ew) where I'd order a Super Burger every lunch break.  They are seriously addictive with their super secret sauce combination.  

Their breakfast buffet is bomb!  I always have to go for the regulars and one word sums that up.  Carbs.  Pancakes, french toast and those delish strawberry muffins!  And seriously, what is up with how good their pistachio whip is on the buffet?  I used to lick the bowl...after it was already made and served...don't worry for all you germaphobes!

I guarantee you that if you check back each season you'll find at least one show to enjoy. Every year their line-up changes and it always features an incredible variety of shows. I've seen a classics such as ""Antony and Cleopatra"" to the interesting (but potentially uncomfortable) ""In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play)."" My outright favorite evening with PICT was during a premiere of a play named ""Our Class,"" which was an incredibly shocking but important play about, sadly, real events: a WWII mass murder of the Jewish community living in a town in Poland. No one wanted to speak during or after that show, and the actors handled the roles and portrayal of both inhumane actions and traumatic events incredibly and impressively well. Kudos to them and all of PICT for tackling such an imposing but important project.

We are renovating a house and need a number of light fixtures, plumbing fixtures, etc.-- the only way we can keep track of them all (and check if they actually might look good together) is to photograph everything we're seriously considering. We tried to explain this and the clerk said nope, not allowed. We asked why. She said, ""I don't know-- they just don't allow it."" Well I bet I know-- they don't want you going online in search of better pricing. But hey, NEWSFLASH-- that's how things work in 2012. I'm not going to drop $1,200 on a chandelier without looking it up online. (For the record, I understand that local businesses aren't usually going to have the lowest price available. I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to support a small business in Pittsburgh that gave me great in-person service. But like hell am I going to spend that kind of money without making sure I'm not getting completely ripped off.)

The front has tall tables and chairs (like bar stool height) and the back has booths and 6 flatscreen TV's. The whole place was redone in 2009 when a new owner bought it, who bought Redbeards in Mt. Washington and totally redid it. The chef is from Grand View, a fantastic actual restaurant, not bar restaurant. So you're basically getting, at normal bar food prices, truly excellent bar food.

The vegetable wrap is phenomenal, the burgers are great, and the ""Codfather"" gigantic fish sandwich is simply amazing, the best outside of Wholey's.

The onion rings are beer battered (not breaded) and fried to perfection. They taste moderately of beer, the true hallmark of excellent rings. The food you're getting here isn't pushing any envelopes but it absolutely is the best bar food in Pittsburgh. Apparently they have a $5 ""express lunch"" that includes a 1/2 sandwich and soup or salad. Never had it but that's extremely cheap.

Beer is fairly priced; Sam Adams and Blue Moon are $3.50 while Yuengling, Coors & Miller are about $2.50, $2 on special. Everything else is under $5.50.

Wing night Wednesdays the good: 25 cent wing night. Best wings I've had in the 'burgh. Wing night the bad: they charge 50 cents per ranch or blue cheese dressing, effectively making 10 wings (the minimum order, which they DON'T disclose) $3 rather than $2.50 which makes it more like 30 cent wing night. Nor do they include celery/carrots, as they do on the menu for regular wing orders. This is the first Wednesday (wing night) they've done this upcharge. I don't mind 30 cent wings, I just like honesty up front. They also don't let you take the wings home that you don't finish. Sorry, but I want two flavors and don't want to weigh 300 pounds so I'm only gonna eat 12-14 wings. We threw away at least a dozen between the 2 of us. People go hungry in this city every night and that's a crime.

The mild buffalo wings are more like medium buffalo wings and are excellent, as are the orange ginger wings. The bbq and honey bbq are what you'd expect. The jalapeno cheddar is fake nacho cheese and pickled jalapenos on top - NOT what we expected and not what we'd get again but still very good.

They have at least 4 or 5 TV's to watch whatever local sports are on. I think my friend will be going back more now that it has been updated and I will only be back on my next trip to Pittsburgh.

The best times I have had at Cain's consist of myself going into the establishment with the predetermined mentality of spending way too much for drinks ( $7.00 for a Jameson and Ginger!!??) and already being three sheets to the wind. 

Don't get me wrong, if you like going to a place that mildly reminds me more of a mosh pit at times than an actual drinking establishment, you would love Cain's. Definitely, avoid going on the weekends.

But, I will admit that Cain's is an awesome place to post up at the bar, drink a few beers, and catch a Pen's game on one of their million TV's. 

Bottom line : This place is not a place where you and your buds can go and get poopy drunk at. Cains is, at best, a bar where you stop during a bar crawl for a beer and a shot.

J ordered the full slab of ribs which came with fresh-cut fries and cole slaw.  While there was a bit too much BBQ sauce on the ribs, they were cooked perfectly, fall off the bone good.  

I was in the mood for a good beer of which they have plenty.  While I normally would order an Abita Purple Haze, I was talked into some shandy that was on special.  Thursday specials are micro-brews - which means that we should really go every Thursday.  But I am getting off track.  When the waitress told me that there were two shandies on tap, she offered to give me a taste of the one in which I wasn't familiar.  The beer that came out was big enough that I didn't really need to order a full glass, but it was good enough that I wanted several. 

We decided to split an order of the pepper jack cheese bites which were served with unnecessary ranch dressing.  The bites were awesome - cheesy, not greasy and excellent breading.  I ordered the California Turkey Hoagie with a side spinach salad.  The spinach salad has feta cheese, walnuts, dried cranberries and warm bacon dressing - all in all, a delicious spinach salad with fresh, crunchy spinach.  The hoagie has fresh turkey - that is featured in several sandwiches and meals and always delicious - avocado, pico de gallo, swiss cheese and lettuce.  I would probably trade out the swiss for maybe pepper jack, but other than that - the sandwich is perfect.  

I know that this place is not everyone's cup of tea, but for my husband and I, it's good food, good beer and decent service. 

The one thing that for me stopped me from giving it 5 stars is that it is so freaking loud in there.  Apparently, this is the hangout for people that want to get really drunk and be really loud - even if there is no need for it.

The following is an email that I sent to the owner, it will shed a little light as to why I feel this way...I will also share his response, and what ultimately became of the situation. I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!

I have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless! Will I come back to your restaurant, I'm not sure. The food is good, but I work hard for my money, and I expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it. 

Sincerely,
 Matt K.

Here is the response that I got

This place is legit!  Moving to the new hood in Dormont means finding a new go to bar.  I need a my hood bar to have a good selection of beer (I accept Yuengling and hopefully a rotating seasonal list) and good bar food.  Good bar food doesn't have to be good.  I mean, it has to be good, but it doesn't have be gourmet poutine, if you know what I'm sayin'?  

Cain's totally surprised me because they have a mega beer list, with lots of drafts on tap, and this particular night Southern Tier Pumking was in the hizzouse!  Their menu is HUGE too!  Tons of faves like wings and burgers but the intriguing ""Codfather,"" which I will take part in at some point!  I was in the mood for a Rachel, because well, why not... it's my name!  

The Rachel was awesome, with a good amount of turkey, but not overwhelming and lots of coleslaw, which is totally how I like it!  The rye was fresh and toasted and it all came together perfectly.  But the fries, the fries win my seal of approval!  They were crisp and seasoned correctly, which is a winning fry in my opinion.

The spinach salad was also AMAZING spinach walnuts,feta,cranberries. The Caesar is what you would expect generous portion but average.

Then a soup choice of French onion or soup de jour  (soup of the day) my husband had the french onion Wow he said it was prepared perfect and how french onion should be served a nice crock full and nice amount of cheese covering and balance of bread and soup. My mom and I had the soup of the day which was a roasted red pepper mushroom soup this was a soup we had never experienced and boy was it fabbie definitely a soup we shall enjoy again.

a 6 oz Filet Mignon and 4-5 oz Lobster tail , Twice baked potato, Fresh white asparagus.

I've been stopping at Cain's since I can't remember when, and maybe their tap selection has something to do with that.  I have never failed to find something interesting and crafty on tap at Cain's.

My favorite night to stop at Cain's is Wednesday.  I try to get there early, because later in the evening, the place is usually packed out, even though there is a lot of seating.  On Wednesdays, Cain's has a special on their excellent chicken wings.  They are done the right way, and among my top favorites in the South Hills.

You can't go wrong at Cain's during happy hour.  Half price on all appetizers and a dollar off all drinks from 5 to 7.  But my favorite plan of attack at Cain's is to arrive around 4:45 and order the ""half sandwich and a soup"" deal they call ""express lunch.""  It is served until 5:00, and you can't beat a half sandwich and two sides for $5.99.  By the time my food arrives, it's happy hour and the beers are a buck off, but you have to be seated in the bar area, supposedly.  My favorite sandwich to get with this deal is the Reuben, served with some volcano chili and slaw, but I've had other interesting sandwiches there as well.  The chili has got some NICE punch to it, and I am definitely a fan.

I remember way back when this place wasn't so pretty, but they have done a nice job with updating the place and you won't be embarrassed to bring a date to this place.  But don't be surprised if you end up having to stand for quite a while before you can get a seat on a Wednesday night.  Chivalry is not dead in Dormont, which is one of my favorite parts of the South Hills, and I have seen young men give up their seats in favor of older ladies at Cain's.

We bookmarked the places and figured eventually we'd hit them all. I called on a Wednesday in February one afternoon asking what time they served breakfast on Sunday's. My wife and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and wanted to grab brunch after we had gone for massages in the morning, somewhere laid back that we could also watch the olympics. When I called I didn't see the Yelp page that mentioned no reservations so I asked anyway. I spoke to Joe Demarco(sp?) who was AWESOME! When I told Joey that we wouldn't be able to make it there until 12:30 (they stop serving breakfast at noon) he told me not to worry and that they'd make an exception for us. When we arrived on Sunday they had a table cleared and were ready for us. The food was fantastic! I got the Harvest Benedict (sauteed spinach and a veggie burger with a poached egg smothered in hollandaise). As a vegeterian I like to see stuff like this on the menu, creative veggie fare. The homefries were crispy and well done, and the hollandaise was rich and creamy. The bloody mary bar was a pretty cool idea as well. We had 2 each and enjoyed switching it up a little with the mixers and the various toppings. Nice job with pickles and the blue cheese stuffed olives!

3328,DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA,IDgW6OkWqIMCo8QWAgMHvA,"Cain's Saloon has popped up on my radar repeatedly since it opened - many people have stood by it as a fantastic dinner spot and bar. And while I certainly didn't dislike my experience here overall I can't say I quite get what all the fuss is about.

I came here for dinner and drinks with a friend and upon first entering we were pleased; the staff got us seats and our waitress very patiently helped us navigate their beer and cider options - which took a while, there were just so many! I truly do praise our waitress and the bar staff for taking my companion's final request, which was a little off-menu. No one complained and they whipped up my friend's drink while I went for a Pear Magner cider. 

The particular night that we went was wing night, and while wings did sound wonderful we ultimately went for a plate of loaded fries in addition to our separate meals. It took a while to get them, but we figured it was getting busier since it was the evening and we let that slide. Here was where the meal began to lose some of its shine - while at first the fries were absolutely delicious, the more of them that I ate the less appetizing they tasted. I suspect that while the top layer was composed of perfectly cooked fries, the last layer of fries at the bottom of the plate was just drenched in extra grease and oil that kind of ruined the fries themselves for me. Plus, when ordering my sandwich I had asked for one of three sauce options listed on the menu - but once it arrived I realized after biting into it that my sandwich contained the wrong sauce. I didn't bother complaining at that point because of how busy it was - I didn't want to wait for a replacement meal; the sauce I got wasn't too bad or spicy for me, so the sandwich itself still tasted good, but it was still a bit frustrating. After actually finishing our meal, it took an INCREDIBLY long time for us to spot our waitress and flag her down for our check. We're not sure why she disappeared for so long; it was definitely odd to have our service go from above average to below average.

And when we ducked into the bathroom on our way out? Good Lord, was that a tiny room! I almost hit someone with the door because you literally only have a foot or two between the door when it opens and the wall, so if anyone is standing on the other side they're often in the door's way by default. And it was almost impossible to sit in the stalls, they were so tiny. Definitely be careful when entering the bathrooms, folks.

Needless to say, my experience was pretty mixed - it definitely started out strong but it kind of went downhill throughout the night, although it never hit actual flat-out bad levels. I'd still come back to Cain's if someone wanted to, as their food was certainly enjoyable enough. It's absolutely a decent place with some decent options for food. It just wasn't incredibly impressive to me after all the hype I'd heard.",1,5Udv4CASAXB2eH66TefWPQ,0,3,2014-03-20,review,3
3329,ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ,RfMP_6u030DHk69NLlkeZg,"Our night at Cain started out as 4/5 stars.  This was my first visit and I was blown away by the extensive menu and attentive service.  I ordered the Shrimp and Strawberry salad - not something I would usually order at a bar.  But I was not disappointed! The shrimp were of a decent size and seasoned well. The salad was huge and at $12 was just right.  My guests ordered a variety of items including Buffalo Chicken dip (amazing); Spinach Artichoke Dip (great); and for their entrees - the Grilled Romaine salad topped with Filet; Surf and Turf ($14 - WHAT?); and a Steak and Egg something sandwich. Everyone seemed delighted with their respective meals and the drinks flowed all night long thanks to our wonderful server whose name I cannot recall.  

Unfortunately, as the evening progressed the bouncer began his shift. Sigh.  I'm sorry, but he just wasn't nice. Not that bouncers need to be cuddly, but dang.  We were seated at the table closest to the door, a table which he clearly despises.  He rudely asked us (the two people seated in the outer seats) to move closer into the table when there was really nowhere for us to go; citing that patrons walking in couldn't do so with us sitting there. Lies.  There was plenty of room for anyone to walk anywhere.  He repeatedly got an attitude with one of our guests both vocally and with his body language; going so far as to seat his stool so close to our table that shoulders were touching. Get over yourself, dude.  I'll visit Cains again, but either won't go when there's a bouncer on duty (which is a ridiculous thing to have to do); or request a table away from the door and annoy the hostess. Either way, he's not a great ambassador for what I'm sure is a great place.",1,5Udv4CASAXB2eH66TefWPQ,0,3,2014-04-22,review,2

What I heard was true after dining here- food is really good, service leaves a lot to be desired. Two of us were the first to arrive for a party of six. We waited a good 10 minutes at the ""please wait to be seated sign"". No one even acknowledged us standing there until two other members of our party finally arrived. They were semi busy but cleared out quickly since it was a 4:25 steelers game and several tables there looked like they were heading to the game. Anyways, a server came over about 5 minutes after we were sat. To get our drink order. She was pretty slow getting our drinks out to us. The other two members of our party arrived by then and when she came back she said the kitchen was running 30 minutes behind and we should order appetizers now if we wanted any. Ok so we ordered 6 old bay wings, 12 thai chili wings, and 2 orders of the cheese sticks. The cheese sticks were the best cheese sticks I have ever eaten! They are huge-3 to an order but these are so thick and gooey....and the marinara served with them is a sweeter marinara, it's very good. I didn't try the old bay wings but they were quickly devoured by the rest of the table. The Thai chili wings had a very nice sweeter flavor. And they were large wings too. Very tasty. She came to take our food order prior to our appetizers coming out. They did take awhile but she did warn us they were slow. Entrees came out quickly however. I had ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It had a horseradish BBQ sauce that sounded really interesting. The server came over halfway through the appetizers and said they ran out of the pulled pork. I was disappointed but I ordered a turkey Rachael with sweet potato waffle fries instead. The sandwich came on marble rye with coleslaw Swiss and thousand island. The fries weren't great and we're kind of soggy. The sandwich though was excellent. Real rotisserie turkey and lots of cold slaw which is how I like it. A steak and egg hoagie was ordered with chips-she said it was really good and it was huge portion wise. Another ordered the pastrami sandwich and another ordered the pastrami salmon blt. Both were said to be tasty. The quesadilla burger and the bacon and blue cheese burger were also ordered and were quickly eaten and said to be delicious . 4 of us took home half of our sandwiches - portions are huge! Our server didn't check on us and it was us who had to flag he down for drinks. This is a great place to watch a game, lots of beers on tap, good food.

What I like about this place is that it's bright, pretty clean, and the attendant is very friendly.  If you go at a good time (weekday evening or early morning on weekends) it's also pretty empty -- which I like.  They also have a little sitting area to hang out in, rather than having to lean against your washing machine.

The downside is that it's more expensive than other laundromats I've been to, and the dryers are pretty tricky (some take forever to dry your clothes, some run too hot, sometimes make your clothes smell like gas... not sure about that last one) so that part is a bit of a guessing game.

3347,sYonLXU0zgZGGaRDJRPxXw,V3e8lr863GidGzUSBnBwqg,"Let's start with the conclusion - this place is the very best breakfast diner in Pittsburgh.  

Why?  In very large part, because *everything* on the menu is made fresh daily.  This includes the ham, which the restaurant roasts every morning, complete with their own glaze.  The ham is cut from the bone to order, absolutely succulent, with a hint of clove.  The ham alone is reason enough to visit this place, but that isn't even the best offering.

First are the pancakes, which includes specialty pancakes like apple and cinnamon and pumpkin - all of which (including buttermilk pancakes) are among the very best pancakes I've ever eaten.  The batter is prepared fresh every morning.  They have a slightly crispy exterior (plenty of butter and sugar in the batter) and fluffy center.  The apple and cinnamon pancakes are so good that I don't even eat them with syrup lest I mask the subtle flavors of cinnamon, cream, vanilla, and apples in the batter - a dusting of powdered sugar and a smear of half-melted butter is all that's needed to elicit an involuntary eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-the-head expression of pleasure.  Seriously, these pancakes are DAMN good!

Second, all the egg entrees are fabulous!  Try the eggs benedict - that juicy ham, fresh cut from the bone, piled high atop two thick slabs of toasted Italian bread, topped with sunny-side-up eggs, and freshly prepared hollandaise.  Fantastic.  The omelets are great, and the ""jumbot"" - an ""everything in the prep table"" hash of stuff and scrambled eggs will satisfy the heartiest of diners.

The food here is really top-notch.  I realize that it's just a diner, but when I see and taste food this good, and this lovingly prepared, I want to see *everything* as perfect as most of the food.  With that in mind, I'd really like to see the restaurant offer real maple syrup - not the imitation ""table syrup"" stuff that I've seen them pour from a milk-carton-type paper container into the syrup bottles!  I'd gladly even pay a $1 premium to have real syrup with those delectable pancakes.  Also, I'd beg them to consider making their own biscuits, and possible serving them with a sausage (or sausage and herb?) gravy.  I'd *crawl* to the Dor-Stop from my home to eat there!

This place is PACKED on the weekends - be prepared to wait unless you get there very early.  The wait, however, will be worth it.  I eat here at least once nearly every weekend for breakfast.",2,2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw,2,5,2008-11-12,review,4

I had 2 eggs over medium, their in-house ham from the bone, Texas toast and potato pancakes which came with my choice of applesauce or sour cream (I got sour cream). The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the ham was nice-- just salty enough. The potato pancakes were different than what I expected.

The hostess said we can have the table for 4 with someone seating in the window box, just don't lean on the window... We said okey-dokey!  Waitress was quick and had coffee right away. She was fast with refills and any waitress that went by with the pot would check to see if we needed refills.  Had an omelet that is very large with veggies.  It was cooked perfectly and the veggies must have been put on the pan first to make sure they were warn and tender.  Potatoes were OK, but nothing special. 

The table was crowded for five, and just when the food was placed on our table, one friend who said he could not make it showed up...Now a table for six.. Not really, but the waitress did not blink and took that order quickly and that food arrived fast... Must have worked with the kitchen to get the order fast.  Thank you!  

Was able to get a taste of the french toast and it was very good.  Someone in our group had the eggs benedict and said they were really good!

-Potato pancakes so good that you'll wish you had multiple orders
-Slabs of ham. So good.

Add in the great service, ease to find parking, and decent prices and this place is truly a gem.

Canadian Friend of Joe (CFoJ) was getting ready to catch the 4:45 flight to Philly, and wanted to share one more meal before leaving the Burgh. He was hungry for breakfast, after all it was only noon and he was still in bed. So he calls me and says meet in Dormont for some serious diner food.

He's already at a table when I walk in, sitting there eating a huge cinnamon roll, split in half, grilled and looking soooo delicious. So he points to the wall and says ""Guy from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives was here"". Spitting pieces of Cinnamon roll at me in his excitement, who knew Canada got the food network?

I ordered the oatmeal pancakes, knowing full well there are eggs in the batter (somethings are just worth having as a vegan) but at least I was smart enough to have the butter on the side so I could discard it later.

He ordered the raspberry french toast, over hard eggs (Canadian for broken yokes) and bacon, a large OJ, coffee, and the cinnamon bun he was noshing when i entered. The man can eat, and he's so thin, I really hate him and his metabolism.

My oatmeal cakes were HUGE, and three to an order, I got the first one down without any problem, they were moist, chewy, flavorful with real oatmeal and cinnamon, and the syrup was almost not needed as they have a natural sweetness to them.

He devoured his french toast, eggs, bacon, saying it was one of the best breakfasts places he's ever been to.

It's a shame we take restaurants for granted, here's a guy from Vancouver, over 3000 miles away wishing the Dor-Stop was in his home town.",1,2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw,2,4,2011-03-05,review,4

My girlfriend and I have been looking for a new breakfast spot for a while and the Dor-Stop has always been high on my list to try.

The place is classic, still has a bar counter, kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant. The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 3/4 full before it was refilled.

Now lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.

I got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.

My girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. 

I recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city.

Order texas toast, two eggs over easy and a side of hollandaise sauce. Then build your own eggs benedict. Saves a vegetarian about $2 on a main which is great!
    I would give it four stars if it weren't for the insane busy-ness of this place. It would be really great if they could expand. They also could really use chairs and benches outside for people who are waiting.

1. Go only with 2-4 people (otherwise you are one of THOSE parties that will hold everything up and screw up the seating)
2. Be prepared to wait.  If you do not wait, consider yourself the luckiest person alive.
3. Order something savory (may I recommend the Breakfast Burrito or the Eggs Benedict?  Everything has a twist and a funny name, so you're going to spend some time actually reading the menu.  Get something special, don't just go with scrambled eggs and bacon - although I'm sure that's delicious too).
4. Order specialty pancakes ""for the table"" (to share).  We haven't been able to get away from the drawing power of the pumpkin pancakes yet.  They are so thick, yet so fluffy at the same time!

Sure, it will be worth it, but if you can swing by early on a weekday you won't have to and the food will be just as good.

I think we waited for half an hour, but we weren't terribly hungry, so it was fine. Finally sat down and looked at the menu deciding what to order. Both the pumpkin pancakes and raspberry french toast looked so good, but I didn't want to be a pig and eat both of them (well, I could if I wanted to). My mother suggested that we can order both items and split it from there. Brilliant! Get to taste the both worlds. :)

Pumpkin pancakes were delish! A bit on the dense side, yet still fluffy. Spices were so fragrant, like it was Thanksgiving! Not terribly sweet, but at the perfect amount where you don't need the syrup. Huge servings; your serotonin levels will rise. :) The raspberry stuffed french toast would probably have to be my favorite. The crusty/crunchy exterior of the french toast slices stole the stage. The whole dish was sweet enough that syrup was also not necessary.

Their peach cobbler french toast special looked tempting, but sadly they ran out right when we were seated. Sad. :(",0,2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw,0,4,2012-05-24,review,1

The Dor Stop is especially known for its pancakes, and they have several to chose from.  After some contemplation I decided on the Pumpkin Pancakes.  And what a great decision it was!  They were amazing!  I put syrup on them, because I'm a sugar whore, but they honestly didn't need it!  They were big, moist, and perfectly sweetened all by themselves!  So tasty!  

Another nice thing about the place is that it's not in Pittsburgh but, rather in the Dormont area outside the 'Burg.  A rather quaint little area it was.  So get down there and check it out!  You won't be disappointed!",1,2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw,0,5,2012-05-27,review,1
3394,kB4FK7vCRML_v9dabD2PiQ,GGpi9Hqvlzl15JJ7IQL-BQ,"The Dor-Stop is a great small breakfast restaurant.  Once you enter the doors of pancake heaven you are greeted with friendly staff and the delicious smells of pancakes and meat on the griddle and other various breakfast aromas.  We came Sunday for breakfast and, boy does this place fill up!  

The Dor-Stop has gained fame from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, but that's not what I care about! I just want the food!  So, that's what I did, I ordered the food after ordering my coffee.  Their menu has all of the classics including their signature pancakes, omelets, french toast and eggs cooked to suit.

My coffee cup and water were kept full and while sipping on my caffeinated beverage, my meal came.  The Dor-Stop produced my order of two eggs over medium, and two large banana, chocolate chip pancakes.  I was speechless once I took a bite of that cakey, breakfast goodness (the pancakes not the eggs!).  The pancakes are really delicious. They have the perfect texture, the perfect taste, the perfect look, the perfect smell... need I go on?  The eggs were good too, I don't want to leave them out, but what egg is going to win again the battle of pancakes v eggs?

Breakfast Breakdown,

The Food: Delicious!
The Value: I believe my two egg combo was $7.99. Breakfast for four with coffee was close to $40. That's not too bad.
The Experience:  It's a small restaurant full of happy people! I happened to glance at the table next to us  and saw the breakfast burrito.  It's massive!
Would I return?: Why, yes. I wish I lived closer so I could eat them every Sunday.
5 stars?: I've been to a restaurant that claimed to have the best pancakes in the world.  They were wrong. The Dor-Stop has the best pancakes and for not claiming to have the best, they get 5 stars, because these pancakes were heaven sent!

When we first got there it was quite busy so expect a little wait. ( Ours was maybe 10 min to be seated)  Wait b/c you will be glad that you did!!
Coffee was typical diner coffee, but I love that so I'm a little biased.
Our server was friendly and efficient.  Our coffee cups never went empty, so that's an A++ in my book.
I  had the breakfast burrito and split an order of pancake with my grandma and boyfriend.  My burrito was HUGE!!  Stuffed with delicious eggs, potatoes, breakfast meats, and cheese....heaven on a plate.  I couldn't finish but it made great breakfast the next day. The pancakes....oh my lord the pancakes....perfection.   They were fluffy and the perfect balance of sweetness.  So good! We just got the regular ones, but they also offer specials. (the special that day was blueberry. Note to self, come back in fall probably offer pumpkin pancakes.) My grandma had eggs over easy and sausage. She enjoyed both and liked that while sausage is greasy hers wasn't disgustingly greasy.  My boyfriend had an omelet that rivaled the size of my burrito. It was stuffed full of yummy veggies and meat.

3401,_ETjNceMcvLYG1L2AZyl1Q,4Lz7h0scebt41Kr8rZM1VA,"WOW. When you read ""best pancakes ever"", believe it. 

My boyfriend and I were on our way from Milwaukee, WI to Easton, PA and figured we should find some good food along the way, and The Dor-Stop fit the bill - we'd be arriving near Pittsburgh at just the right time for breakfast. 

This place was bustling - we got there at about 8:30am on a Saturday, but we only had to wait a few minutes. 

Our waitress was sweet and courteous and she told us about the popular items on the menu because we'd told her it was our first time there. 

He and I both got the Eggs Combo - two eggs, choice of meat (bacon, sausage or ham off the bone). He got banana pancakes and bacon and I got pumpkin pancakes with the ham. 

The ham was wonderful - albeit a little salty (but all ham tastes salty to me), but by the time I finished my perfect over-medium eggs and one of my pancakes I was pretty full, so I wasn't able to finish the ham. That didn't stop me from sneaking a couple of bites of my boyfriend's banana pancakes though! 

If I ever find myself driving east again, I will be sure to take the detour out to the Dor-Stop. I will be dreaming about the pumpkin pancakes until I can manage to somehow make something half as good.

3402,f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA,N8NygoZEUNTyrEh50SR4qg,"My husband and I were looking for a new place to try for brunch on Labor Day. Instead of going to our standby, the Original Pancake house, I suggested we try the Dor-Stop. We arrived at 12:30 and were soon joined by the 3rd person in our party. The hostess informed us that we were next on the list for a table and would be seated soon. I was surprised at how busy it was on a holiday. This small little diner was packed with people. Every table was full as well as every seat at the counter. About ten minutes later, a waitress came over and called two parties that arrived after us. My husband had to go talk to her and explain how we were waiting longer. She apologized for skipping us and was able to seat us right away. Once seated, I had a difficult time deciding what to order from the extensive menu. Wow! They have a huge selection. 

I finally decided on the special, Apple Harvest French toast with bacon. When I asked the waitress about the special, she had a difficult time describing it but I still wanted to give it a try. Once we ordered, it took well over 15 minutes for our food. I understand that they were very busy but that amount of time did seem a bit excessive for diner food. When my french toast arrived, it was not exactly what I was expecting per the description but, it was very tasty. The french toast had a nice crisp on it and the cream cheese sauce had a lot of flavor. However, for being APPLE harvest french toast, it was certainly lacking apples or apple flavoring. This french toast would have been perfect with slices of cooked apples on top instead of the small apple pieces that were mixed in with the cream cheese. The bacon also lacked a nice crispiness. 

I also had the opportunity to try my husband's banana chocolate chip pancakes. Although they looked delicious with the bananas and chocolate chips baked into the pancakes, they tasted rather salty. My husband agreed with my assessment. It seemed like the cook was a little heavy handed when adding salt to the batter. Overall, I wasn't overly impressed though, I would give the Dor Stop a second chance based on their huge selection to choose from.",0,2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw,0,3,2012-09-06,review,0

However; we knew about that situation in advance, and actually we didn't have to wait too terribly long for a table).

I ordered a vegetarian (three-egg) omelette with egg whites, which came with toast & hash browns - and my husband ordered a vegetarian burrito.  We both ordered coffee, too.

Our server was *terrific*; she had a great sense of humor (we had a very amusing conversation with her) and she was also very attentive.  The people at the cash register (who also took names for tables) were friendly, too.  Afterwards, I complimented the wife half of the owner couple (who have owned the Dor-Stop for 26 years) and also their daughter & the (three) cooks.

3416,IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q,OI6aw0y57At1U_NiJKecXw,"Well I've finally had a chance to visit the now famous Dor-Stop.  I went on a weekday morning so that I could actually get a seat and have the food at it's prime--not cooked in a hurry to see how the food really was.  Well, that was also the only time I had, as well.

I was greeted quickly and seated and given a nice cup of coffee.  They did an exceptional job of keeping the coffee mugs full (another reason  to go on a weekday) and it was good coffee.  

I had to try the hot cakes, but didn't want to OD on carbohydrates so I got the Egg Combo with the speciality hotcakes.  The waitress recommended the banana oatmeal or the apple cinnamon.  I went with the banana oatmeal.  Two over easy eggs and bacon, though they offer sausage patties or links in both regular (sage) and hot.

My food came quickly and I was disappointed to find the eggs sharing the plate with the hotcakes.  I like my food separated and dippy eggs leave a residue that sometimes can't be mopped up with bacon.  I guess I would have preferred a plate with the eggs/bacon and a plate with the hotcakes.  

The eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon.  Crispy yet chewy.  I have to eat my eggs and bacon before I can eat my hotcakes, because, again, I don't like my food touching--especially something sweet and savory.  

Let's talk about the hotcakes.  They were served with a big dollop of whipped butter which I loved.  Whipped butter spreads pretty easy.  I like that.  I'm picky.  Especially with breakfast.  There were slices of banana cooked in which I also liked.  They tasted like a diabetics worst/best nightmare.  They were sweet and fork tender like a nice pancake should be.  They would have been fine without syrup.  When I added syrup it felt like I was eating a slightly sweeter version of banana bread.  I wanted to stop at one.  I really did.  I really really did.  I was getting full.  I can stop eating food that isn't good without much of a problem.  I had a problem with that second hotcake

My other ""complaint"" is that is is rather expensive for a small diner.  I paid a little over $10 for my breakfast.  For $10, I would have preferred a more generous portion of bacon, at least.  My idea of pricing is a bit off, I guess, mainly because I live in an area outside of Pittsburgh that is a lot less expensive.  

So, I will go back, for sure.  The breakfast is GOOD and I think most places that attempt to serve breakfast should be GOOD.",0,2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw,0,3,2013-03-27,review,0

The pancakes are all fantastic.  I've had every combination on the menu and then plenty more (they'll usually grant a request if they have the ingredients and they usually run a weekend special).  I highly suggest the apple walnut, banana chocolate chip, the oatmeal raisin, and most importantly...  PUMPKIN (the best in town).

Lori's Raspberry French Toast is the obligatory first dine, just stay away from the other iterations that aren't first coated in corn flakes prior to landing on the griddle.

The jumbots, eggs benedict, and potato pancakes all also represent fantastic choices.  If you have a choice of meat, hands down get the ""ham off the bone"".

One other key note...  Bob, Vicky, and their daughter Lori go out of their way to make people happy.  They always bring samples out to those waiting for a seat and offer coffee to hold people over when it's cold out.

It was a weekday at around 11am, and the place was still packed. I sat at the counter after a brief wait, because it was the only available seat in the house. The gentleman next to me, as it turns out, is related to the restaurant owner. He gets a five-star review, but I swear I'm not even taking that into account with my official five-star Yelp rating.

The wait staff was very busy, but also attentive. Great mix of friendly and efficient. I couldn't decide what to order - everything sounded amazing. I ended up getting banana chocolate chip pancakes with bacon. The pancakes were probably the best I've ever tasted. A little crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. I used ZERO syrup. I prefer my bacon a little crispier, but it was still good.

My husband loves the ""Guy's Version"" of Vicki's Jumbot ham.   i usually get an omelet, and they're ok.  Nothing out of this world.

While Pamela's serves up the amazing thin crepe-like pancakes, The Dor-Stop serves up the fluffy equivalent. The list of different combos goes on and on. And if you're with a really good friend, you can order two different ones and split them! Genius!

I split the banana chocolate chip pancakes and the pumpkin pancakes. While the pumpkin was incredible, I think I slightly more enjoyed the banana chocolate chip just because the combo is such a winning one! But come fall, I may be all over the pumpkin ones again. Although, I'd probably be cheating myself because I have to work my way down the list of them all!

The only thing that would pull me away would be the french toast. It almost seems cruel I have to choose between the two! And it's so dirt cheap too! I think for three people it was around $25 bucks. With coffee and some sides!

When I moved to Dormont a few years ago, I was told about this amazing breakfast place that was featured on the Food Networks show, ""Diners Drive-Ins, & Dives"".  I now know why this place is a Pittsburgh staple - Delicious food, Friendly service, and a Cozy atmosphere.

If you go on the weekend, you'll typically see a line.  Don't let it turn you away!  It usually moves quick and its worth the wait.  It's a small diner atmosphere, so i wouldn't recommend it for parties larger than 4.  Once you get inside, I assure you that you'll be hooked, too.

I've tried several things on their menu - The breakfast burrito - HUGE and delicious with eggs, potatoes, sausage... The pancakes - dense and hearty!  The French toast - who would have thought cornflakes applied to this would make it even yummier?  And my FAVORITE - Vicki's Jumpot - Everything you could ever want in a breakfast!  Eggs, potatoes, ham, cheese, peppers, onions... and though it comes with Italian toast, I swap it for some of the best marble rye in the area.  Incredibly filling, big portions but little prices and always tasty.

Yes, it's got to the point where the hostess knows my name when we enter - ""Ashley, party of 2?""  That's me!  I look forward to any Sunday I get to dine at the Dor-Stop.  Sometimes you've gotta go where everybody knows your name...",0,2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw,1,5,2013-08-30,review,1

We were looking for a good breakfast place on Saturday and I found this one on Yelp. The reviews were great and the pictures looked so good that we had to give it a try. Thank you yelpers for helping me find this gem!

I had the Jumbot ""Guy style"". It was so good I HAD to eat the whole thing. Which was no easy feat considering how big of a plate it was. A heaping plate of everything but the kitchen sink. Eggs, hash browns, pepper jack cheese, onions, peppers, hot sausage, and more! On top if that, my boyfriend and I had to try a specialty pancake as well. Luckily you can get just one. We had the apple cinnamon cake and it was absolutely heavenly. Crispy on the outside with a doughy, yet done, center. It melted in your mouth!

He had the regular breakfast with the potato pancakes which The Dor-stop is apparently known for. I didn't get a chance to try them since he demolished it in mere minutes. I'm assuming they were delicious. 

It was reasonably priced and very cute. We were fortunate enough to get a table right away but I've heard there can be a pretty long wait. Sometimes out the door which makes perfect sense after tasting this delicious food.",0,2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw,0,5,2013-12-16,review,1

I've been asked why I have it only 3 stars with such a glowing review. Well, I don't prefer greasy spoon joints, but if it's your thing u will like it! 

What makes this greasy spoon joint different than others is the amazing variety of pancakes and french toasts- you will not get bored with your breakfast here! As a standard on the menu, they have many flavors to choose from: pumpkin, banana, blueberry, choco chip, raspberry, etc. I ordered the special of the day: chocolate cherry cheesecake pancakes. They were pretty good! I liked that there were actual cherry pieces in the filling- I appreciate real fruit being used in my breakfasts. If u like a pancake that holds up against the weight of toppings and syrup, while maintaining a soft spongey texture, you will like these. I hate when pancakes get immediately soggy- these do not! 

The boyfriend ordered Bob's specialty, as it is not a standard breakfast item either- eggs with German potato pancakes, applesauce, and sour cream- it did not disappoint! The potato pancakes were a tad on the sweet side, but I liked them. 

Another great thing here is the down-home feel of the place- everyone is very friendly.

Is their food really tasty or they're popular because the network show? From my perspective, I detest their service, the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable. Also the food was unpalatable. I order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs. I was too full and their portion is huge so I left two pieces of pancakes. The waitress don't even bother to ask me if I need a box to take it home or if everything is good. Although she did refilled my coffee once, I barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customers.I think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when I tipped her.

3463,rBLM0bkvk3PfJTG8vkynOQ,vLhSYrBlj3cLswJfimjaUg,"Located up Potomac from the hotel my girlfriend and I were staying at, and just past the train stop into downtown, Dor-Stop was an easy choice for breakfast when doing my pre-trip food research. Getting its name from the bedroom community it's located in, Dormont, it benefits from a charming mini-downtown area immediately around it, as well as lots of brick houses, although some have seenbetter days. 

Dor-Stop is diner chic through and through, serving the breakfast and lunch crowds only. Nic nacs and local sports teams' placards adorn the walls, as well as a proudly displayed signed poster from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives after that show's stop here. A mix of booths, tables and a few counter seats could cram several dozen people in.

You don't have to do any research about what's popular here, just take a look at a good chunk of the menu or what the person next to you is eating: the hotcakes. With a dozen options, there's a lot of choice and they're all tempting. I settled on the apple walnut hot cakes with sausage on the side. We didn't have to wait long but it felt like a while hungrily watching all the delicious looking food come out of the open kitchen or sitting in the window.

Once in front of me, I was staring at three thick hot cakes with apples chunks and walnuts cooked into them and topped with icing sugar, along with two sausage rounds. The hot cakes were utterly fantastic, with a pleasing denseness but with just enough air in them to keep them from being chewy, The apples were cooked perfectly, soft but not mushy, and along with the walnuts added some texture. I was initially disappointed that the sausage came in round form instead of links as they tend to be drier, but these were nicely browned and still juicy, albeit a bit too greasy. 

My girlfriend went for the lunch time food, getting the Chick 'O' Philly hoagie  which came with sliced chicken breast, sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers, tomato lettuce and Swiss cheese. It was a winning combination of ingredients and the thick bun made for a even heftier sandwich, and as a good sandwich should be it was greater than the sum of its parts. The fries it came with were a solid entry - lightly browned, thick cut but still nice and crispy. 

On a return trip, I went with the plain hot cakes and they were just as good as the apple walnut ones, a sign of great fundamentals when you're doing something as seemingly basic as a hot cake. Kudos. 

Service was friendly and attentive, with a ton of coffee top ups. You'll be challenged to get past half empty in your cup at any point in the meal.

Dor-Stop seemed like just a convenient spot to fuel up for a day of tourism but turned out to be a damned good spot with memories of its own: the best pancakes I've ever had.",0,2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw,0,5,2014-07-04,review,2

Their Italian jumbot was also featured on the show- incredible and spicy which is what I really liked about it. Their hot chocolate is amazing- sooo chocolatey and just the best hot coco around.

Having been featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, it has become a well known place to enjoy the mornings and afternoons of the weekend. Located on a quaint street in Dormont, Dor-Stop is always full to the brim with awaiting customers. 

I ordered a plate full of gooey chocolate pancakes with a side of sausage patties and lyonnaise potatoes. The pancakes were so, so delicious. They were thick and dense, but weren't too thick that they were difficult to eat. The sausage patties were cooked just right. They were juicy, and greasy, and simply amazing. The lyonnaise potatoes were a nice addition. They are my favorite type of potato. My boyfriend got Guy's version of the jumbot. It was loaded with hot sausage, potatoes, eggs and peppers. He loved it, and so did I! 

The atmosphere of Dor-Stop is that of a typical diner. Various memorabilia and other types of old-time posters adorn the walls, which makes for a very comfortable feel. The service was great for being so busy, and we only had to wait a short amount of time for our food.

This is your quintessential diner.  Friendly, sassy staff that make you feel like you are at home.   Wait for a table (because there will be a wait) or try to snag a seat at the counter either way you are getting big portions served to you quickly.  

I got the jumbot (basically an egg scramble with various meats and veg) with the hot sausage and a side of German potato pancakes.   The hot sausage made what would have been a relatively pedestrian dish quite good. I probably could have ate just a bowl of that. The second best thing I tried there was the potato pancake.  Really nice flavor and they give you the option of sour cream or applesauce as a condiment.  I tried both and the sour cream was the clear winner there.  I tried my wife's chocolate chip banana pancake and it was also quite good.

3469,Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg,U5Sx4twhdaBTt2AWZeLO0w,"Ok, so I know this place is somewhat of an institution now because of their Food Network exposure, but I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that I did not enjoy my Dor-Stop experience.

We came here many months ago after hearing all of the hype. I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there). 

Anyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.

It had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, ""Are you really hungry or just really impatient?"" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway). 

Hmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.

I dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience.",0,2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw,0,2,2014-07-31,review,6

I know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert, but I hate pancakes. I just don't understand them, they are odd and moist, and nowhere near as delicious as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset, and am now forever changed. 

The Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious and almost cake-like. They aren't thin crepes, or undercooked globs of batter, but instead sweet, fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut, but others love the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend ordering the ""Egg Combo"": 2 hot cakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. Go all out, you deserve it. 

On a recent visit, I also discovered the french toast menu, which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot cake. When pumpkin french toast is a special on the menu, I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven. 

I've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no complaints. The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu.

With that being said, the hot cakes are a great go to. BUT my alllll time favorite is the eggs benedict. They use thick Texas toast and ham cut off the bone. I'm from MI and grew up on Honey Baked Ham so trust me when I say, dor stop has some good ham. 

If you're having a sweet tooth kinda day you have to have the raspberry french toast. Very sweet though.

Now, of course she would gladly take the chocolate (but me being mom say no with breakfast) they will not add bananas to the pancakes.

3497,DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA,ZdL4dt0m-nXhHYJlkwqebA,"Well, looks like I'm adding yet another 5-star review for Dor-Stop. But hey, they definitely deserve it! In fact Dor-Stop is so good that I came here two days in a row a couple weekends ago - once for a sit-down meal, and once to get a meal to-go just so I could try a second item on the menu.

I actually hadn't eaten at Dor-Stop in years until earlier this month - their hours and my schedule don't tend to mesh. But one afternoon I just happened to be using 1/2 a vacation day, so I came with a family member. Since it was the middle of the day on a Friday, the place was fairly empty, which I definitely didn't mind - this place is pretty cozy and so it gets cramped quickly during weekend dining rushes.

But on to the food, the important part of this review! My dining companion ordered a salad - complete with French fries, 'cause that's how we do salads in Pittsburgh - and I ordered their Feta Burger. Sure, their Raspberry stuffed french toast caught my eye...but Feta burger! How often do you see that on the menu? And I loved that burger, by the way - it was well cooked and the toppings blended perfectly (I snagged a few mushrooms from my companion's salad which made it even better), and definitely felt like good diner food. I left feeling super happy with my meal.

Buuuuut...the next day I still couldn't get that french toast of my mind. I just couldn't. So I called in an order for pick-up - good thing I did, too, because there was nowhere to sit when I came in! Saturdays are definitely jam-packed here, understandably so. Well, I got my food, brought it home, and proceeded to devour it. Just, YUM! Seriously - that french toast is a MUST!

If I was going to complain about anything it would be that the seating really isn't the most comfortable on the planet, buuuuut...I can't hold it against them. I just can't. Not after that french toast. See you next time, Dor-Stop!",5,2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw,2,5,2014-11-24,review,4

I was able to find parking on the street and the meters don't take effect until after 8am.  We had arrived around 7:35 so I figured we'd have enough time before I had to feed the meter.

There was only 2 other customers at the bar when we arrived.  We had our choice of seating and we had chosen to sit near the window.  Coffee up and ordered and our server was back consistently to make sure our coffees were filled.  On the table we noticed they had non dairy creamer and since both my wife and I aren't fans of non dairy creamer we had asked if we could have a small serving of milk and our server brought that over right away.

Being our first time I had to go through the menu to see what I was wanting.  I didn't want to eat too much since I had to drive back home but I did find something of interest.  My wife usually gets steak and eggs but she didn't this time.  I had sort of wanted her to get that so I could have some steak but she went with the ham and eggs with German potato pancakes and white toast.  

I had gone with the all American which was 1/3lb burger, eggs, and lyonese potatoes which is basically homefries with onions with toast.  I also ordered a side of bacon.  I noticed the side of bacon was 3.10 which is kind of a lot but they gave me probably 6 slices or more.  I'm used to only getting 3 or 4 slices usually.  

We didn't order anything that they could impress us with I suppose.  It's not like we went with an item like hotcakes or a skillet or anything like that just a relatively conservative breakfast.  I did have some of my wife's potato pancakes and ham and they were both very good.

I have to say this is a no frills pizza shop, and my pizza was ready to go in 10 minutes both of which I appreciate.  The cheese, sauce, pepperoni, and seasoning were delicious.  These three components are of equal quality, and the sauce may be better than the pizza powerhouses around the city (Mineo's, Fiori's, Doughboy's, Vincint's {while Vincent was still around}), but the crust is terrible.  I love the thinness and crunch of the crust, but there is no doughy-ness to it at all.  My ideal crust is thin and rigid, but once the surface is cracked when you fold it it has a little bit of dough in it.  This did not...I wouldn't say it was like a saltine, but I would say it has frozen pizza qualities.

Campiti's is a hole-in-the-wall, formica countered, 70's-paneled, Pepsi menu board behind the cash register kind of place. There's not much seating, the t.v. is a tiny tube job from the 80's, and your pie comes on a piece of cardboard wrapped in a paper bag. 

And the service? Well, they're efficient. They don't care if you like them, they just want to get you your food, and fast. 

But who cares? The reason I make it a personal mission to go to Camps every time I return to Pittsburgh is the pie. It's thin and crisp, yet solid. Nice browning all over. The sauce is a well-seasoned red gravy that provides a tasty base for the copious amounts of mozzarella and whatever other toppings you want. Me, I go for the pepperoni - which is the type that cups up in the oven, forming little pools of fat - and anchovies.

The car sounds like death once you turn the engine on.  You know....the endless scenarios that go on in my head that drives me crazy (haha, get it?!)!

You could probably go crazy just finding a garage that's not going to be shady and give you a long list of things that need to be ""fixed.""  That's why it's finally nice to find a place that will be straight up with you about what needs fixed (or sometimes maybe nothing at all...score!).  Plus they don't charge you a small fortune for labor.  I understand labor can be a dirty job...but please....child labor is also dirty job and women don't get to charge for that!  

The two really awesome things I've noticed about them is they're incredibly quick with fixing your car.  You can usually call them day of your car breaking and still get looked same day, if not the day after.  The other thing is that they look around for the cheapest parts to fix your car with.

Ruffing originally suggested I take my car to a dealer, since it's an uncommon model and they didn't know what the problem was.  I asked if I could just pay for a vehicle diagnostic, since they're more likely to be honest than a dealership. They said it would take around a day-and-a-half to get to it.

Almost three days later, I hadn't heard back from them.  Since I need my car on a daily basis, it was frustrating that they were well past their quoted time with no updates as to what was going on.  The repairs are what should take time - not a diagnostic.

My biggest issue was the attitude I received when I called.  When I called to see why there was a delay, the mechanic became agitated.  His tone became condescending when he told me it's my fault for leaving the car with him -- that I just HAD to have him look at it and I was SO against going elsewhere.  He said he had cars sitting there for weeks that he hasn't even touched yet (?) so he can't bother with mine. Ultimately I had to get my car towed to a dealership anyway, since I couldn't afford to have my car sit at their shop for ""weeks"".

I wished they were more up front with how back logged they were, rather than trying to give me a schedule they couldn't abide by, and then take their stress out on me when I followed up with them.

Better to stay clear and save your money.  
Judging from the empty tables the luster and joy of the Namaste we remembered is no longer.

We experienced the following sub par  dishes while dining after 8 pm on a Friday evening in an empty restaurant:

Bland reheated Samosas.
Flavorless Malek Paneer. ( the cheese pcs were quite good despite)  inconsistent  and barely there flavors of certainly fresh frozen spinach mix. 
Barely reheated Naan. 

We traveled to eat at Namaste specifically based on delightful past experience. Obviously that feeling is long gone.  The staff  were content to chat with friends and answer frequent texts and cell phone calls while we ate. 

The loud thump of bass from modern indian music with the  electric din of the TV playing Bollywood extracts might have been a nice distraction in a busy restaurant.  Instead  when added to the ding of texts and cell phone calls the loud background noises detracted rather than added  anything to an already mediocre dining experience.",0,n7G2XFGvmS3duDJ4AzjKiQ,0,2,2011-01-15,review,1

It was so unappetizing that we hardly ate anything and got out of there as soon as possible.  I don't think I can go back there given their low standard of hygiene.

Their nan is average in texture but has garlic and herbs, so it's now foccacia nan and tastes delicious.  Papadum is done well.  Lamb kabobs are good, but I wish they had lamb curry.  Their selection of meat is small relative to the size of the buffet.

On the other hand, they have plenty of vegetarian items, but I prefer to avoid cream, butter and cheese that I didn't eat much of them.  I did try the spinach and they have the most wonderful version of spinach: it's cheesy spinach (but doesn't look like there's melted cheese in it).  Awesome.  

But then again, their chickpeas were in a sauce that tasted like a combination of spaghetti sauce and ketchup-- yuck!

I have also made it a point to try each sour cream flavor they sell there, as they have a huge section devoted to sour cream, including flavors from different countries like El Salvador and Mexico. Who knew there were country-specific sour creams?!

Their produce section improved vastly when the Las Palmas guys took over. They sell latino specialties, like yuca, prickly pear, nance, and young coconut, along with several varieties of dried peppers. 

Their butcher section is awesome too; they have all kinds of specialty meats, fresh chicharron, and you can buy queso blanco by the pound.

I have never seen the variety of beans that this place has, either. Literally, almost an entire row devoted to canned and dried beans! Being a vegetarian, I was extremely pleased to discover this.

That said, we've found that it's a total mistake to order anything else off the menu -- except at breakfast, which again is pretty good.  (Their omlets are huge!)

Disappointing to say the least.

I started out with chicken noodle soup (w/ no noodles) and a very spicy bloody ( I know. I know. I am an avid evening bloody mary drinker.) The bloody mary was pretty awesome for what I assume is a pre-made mix. I also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell! Iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers, and dry swordfish. Lame. My dad got a meatball casserole which is something I would have never ordered...meatballs and casserole aren't a selling point for me, let alone as a package deal.  This meatball casserole dish was just pasta and meatballs...thankfully for my dads heart. 

My sister got a salad (again just iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers) with chicken fingers.  She also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average. 

I guess pizza is what Bados is known for so you should just stick with that if you go.

My first expierence with this place was two years ago, I had spent the entire day in the waiting room of St. Clair Hospital with my mother who was admitted finally at 8pm, she was fine and released a few days later. But at 8pm I was ready to eat anything and Bado's was on the way home. So I parked and walked I'm and the place was packed. Good sign. So a seat at the bar opened and the Pens were playing. So I ordered a bottled IPA and read over the menu. I needed to power carb after a long day of sitting in a hospital waiting room. The bartender who doubled as a pizza chef told me the white pizza was exceptional, so I took his advice and ordered a medium, figuring I could have it for lunch the next day. What arrived was this wonderfully thick, cheesy, reeking of garlic in a good way, just what I needed, comfort food that instantly made the days worries seem distant. The first bite was heaven, chewy center, crisp bottom, olive oil coating my mouth, ooey, gooey italian cheeses, saltiness from the black olives I ordered as a topping. This was pizza! Two slices and I was full, I drank my beer and paid the bill, and walked out with lunch and dinner for the next day.

For me, my fallback, can't miss restaurant is Bado's. First off, the menu is huge- pizza, hoagies, pasta, sandwiches, big burgers, Boarshead hotdogs, and huge apps. Everything I have tried there so far has been above average, except maybe their lasagna which I found to be watery and tasteless. If you get a salad, make sure you try their house dressing. It's their own vinaigrette that comes in a Grolsh bottle and is by far one of the best dressings I've ever had. Make sure you try it on the giant antipasti salad (which you should split with someone), and pair that with one of their calzones (my favorite is the reuben calzone, but the meatball is excellent as well). Their pizza buffet is also good if you want to try a lot of different toppings. 
If you're looking for a good beer, Bado's has a great selection of craft and microbrews on their huge board, and the choices are always changing.
You will also want to come to Bado's on weekend mornings for their breakfast. The omelets are huge and they have tons of toppings to choose from, and the rest of their breakfast choices are above average. Even the coffee is good!
The drawbacks to Bado's are that they're almost always busy, and tables are a little cramped. Expect to wait a few minutes when you get there, and don't expect stellar service. The wait staff is good but they're always busy, so you'll probably be waiting for a refill. Also, I like to have fries with my sandwich or burger, and while their fries are pretty good, they don't have them as a side. You have to order off their appetizer menu, and the order is too big for one person and pricey.",0,qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw,0,4,2011-03-08,review,0

The waitress's working weekends are pretty fantastic. The guys that work during the work are so-so. I don't have any experience with the bartenders, as we always sit at a table and eat.
The one drawback for me is how it's a bit ""too"" family friendly for me. I love children (work with them everyday!) but it seems that families here feel comfortable letting their children do whatever they want. Maybe it's because the environment already seems loud, parents feel they can let their children misbehave and it will go unnoticed.

The place is nice with a warm, inviting atmosphere. 
Our server was friendly, but clearly dealing with to my tables. He actually made me feel anxious when he'd stop by!
My family decided to split a traditional pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. My wife and I added a dozen Guinness/ Honey Mustard wings and split a Reuben.

The wings came out in record time and were pretty good. Although, I still don't think the Guinness aspect did anything for the flavor. They sure tasted like any other honey mustard wing I've ever had.

The Reuben was average, but very large. It came with potato chips and a pickle spear. For the $9 price tag, you'd think they could do fries over chips.

The pizza was good; not great. Based on reviews, I thought the pizza would be even better. Maybe I'm being a bit picky, but there are enough great pizza joints in the city that you can afford to be.

All in all, Bado's is a nice place to have a casual dinner. I wouldn't go out of my way to try it, but if you're local give it a go.

With that in mind, because I often come here craving pizza and I was a child patron, I tend to just forget that, oh yeah: I can get alcohol as well. That said, my family has actually purchased six-packs from the bar since Bado's is easier to get to than a beer distributor, so yes, I'd say they have a decent beer selection if we're taking the time to buy and carry a six pack home.

One of my favorite things from Bado's is actually their calzones, which are enormous and yet, oddly enough, ""light."" No, not light in calories, but light in the amount of grease and oils in the meal. This, of course, is compared to take-out chains, so I'm sure it's still way too much for a meal to be considered healthy. But still, I've always felt that their calzones have the perfect blend of toppings, sauces, and so forth, and they're borderline divine. The pizza is delicious as well, and Bado's also has a bunch of other meal options like sandwiches, soups and salads, so you're sure to find something here.

Just keep in mind, Bado's is popular and it gets crowded. Fast. Be prepared for a wait or try to show up during slow hours, i.e. not right after work - especially on a Friday.

Clean, well maintained but nothing shiny or fancy here. Looking over the menu, I noticed some classics and some distinct choices. Sandwiches, soups, salads, pizzas and calzones. Some with toppings/fillings you would not expect. Feeling unadventurous, we decided to order their (famous) wedding soup, a cheese pizza and a sausage calzone to be able to try a few of the classics. The soup came out first. The meatballs were tasty but otherwise, I'm not sure why it would be famous. It definitely did not stand out to me. Another item that did not stand out, the pizza. I was looking for something more. The pizza sauce was a bit tart for me. The real winner of the meal was the sausage calzone (which we added ricotta to). The sausage had a great spice to it. The heat was nicely complimented by the creamy cheese and crisp crust. Overall, good food for a neighborhood bar.",3,qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw,2,4,2014-03-02,review,4

I hadn't been in since 2008 or so which was pre-food allergies for me. My friends got pizza and said it was the best they had had in a long, long time. I really don't think you can go wrong with any of the toppings.

If you've read some of my other reviews, you know I have 14 food allergies. This makes it almost impossible to dine anywhere, but when a restaurant feeds me with ease, I am a happy camper! They accommodated me with no problem and I had a delicious grilled chicken salad! I was very impressed.

My mom was not too keen on her bruschetta wedge salad, mainly because of the dressing (which is homemade, however I do love their homemade greek dressing!). She still managed to devour most of it, though!

 I have eaten at Bado's before and have had pizza that was pretty tasty. So when my roomate wanted to go there, I was pretty excited. There were 4 of us. Two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins. My burger was delicious. It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. 

While my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. 

I will never eat at Bado's again. A good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes. I have been places where there have been food issues before and I have also worked in a restaurant. I completely understand that mistakes happen.

Hot dogs and more bar food type stuff. The fries are double-fried (Belgian style) and plentiful. High points of the sandwich menu: The giant fish, the Big Ben cheesesteak (toppings include fries & coleslaw), and the half-pound keilbasa with horseradish, brown mustard, and sauerkraut. 

Good pizzas too. The Swissvale Shroom is awesome mushroomy goodness, and I love the Popeye's on a whole wheat crust.

One big warning: Service is wonky, especially if you order both pizza and sandwiches. The pizza kitchen is on a different schedule from the sandwich/dogs kitchen, and they make _no_ attempt to coordinate. Pizzas take 30 minutes and dogs take 10-15, so if you order a sandwich and your buddy orders a pizza, you'll be finished eating before his food gets there. 

Down sides: 
- The burgers are not very good. They come out large and dry. 
- Service is quirky (as mentioned above). 
- Gets crowded, especially on weekends. They frequently have a seating list in the dining room side, but I think the bar side is still ""grab a table"" - that's confusing.

That said, the best selection of beer I've found in this city has been at D's.

D's has a great system, if you buy a bottle of beer to take out of the restaurant they take 1 dollar off the bottle.  This dollar off doesn't matter when you consider how small a normal bottle is, but when you look at the larger bottles it does.  The prices for their larger bottles with the dollar off are not much higher than you would pay in a specialty beer shop in a less regulated state.  The only problem is that you have to commit to drinking three or four beers instead of one - I'm not really seeing the issue with that, but I'm sure someone will.

It was cooked just right on the outside, inside and served up with a freshly steamed bun. Yum. We also skipped the fries and enjoyed a baked, soft pretzel instead. This thing was fluffy, chewy and delectable. 

The only thing I would ask for more of is maybe a heftier frank. Don't get me wrong--everything was beyond delicious. I just noticed there wasn't much meatiness involved, and with all those topping options you want the hot dog to stand out too.

My BF and I got the Balboa, the BBQ Texas, and two dogs, mac n' cheese and Mason Dixon with with cheese.

The burgers had really delish toppings but the meat was so dry. It was overcooked and did not have one bit of juicyness dripping down my hand. Missing that major component they were truly lackluster. The macaroni dog wasn't that great either. Mac n' cheese should be creamy, salty, buttery. So sorry but this weenie came up flat too. I did like the Mason Dixon!

Obviously, the beer selection is great. I don't know how many different brews they typically have on hand, but it's a lot.  And you're encouraged to go pick out your own beer from the walk-in cooler, even if you're sitting at the bar.  The staff there is always friendly and you can sample some of the beers on tap if you're unsure of what you want.

The food is pretty good too.  The dogs can be simple or loaded with all kinds of toppings, and are a staple of D's.  They also have a good selection on the rest of their menu too.  Chili cheese fries - great.

If selection drives your decision-making, definitely head on over.  However, if you'd like to receive anything other than slow, resentful service from your waitstaff, or food that is anything above sub-par, head on by without stopping.  I've lived just down Forbes from D's for 3 yrs, and walk down there with friends a lot during the summer and early fall.  I'm also a former bartender and waitress, so I can say with experience and certainty that I've received just downright terrible service there about 80% of the times I've been.  Once, a friend and I stopped in for lunch with her kids and ended up waiting for the check 18 minutes after we'd asked to receive it.  We were both fuming, and the waitress just looked annoyed and kept ignoring us to chat with her buddy.  Another time, my husband and I came in 15 minutes before the ordering deadline, and watched as the waitress did not approach our table until exactly the cut-off time.  She proudly announced that we could no longer order food (we just wanted pretzels, for god's sake).  Food is pretty lackluster, although it's a nice touch that they have veggie dogs.  Upstairs, expect about the same level of service, with a douchy element of annoyed resentment from the bartender, along with even douchy-ier clientele. 

I know D's is a favorite neighborhood place, but I'm tired of the abuse from waitstaff who look annoyed that I'm even there.  If this was just a once-in-a-while occurrence, I'd be forgiving, but 3 years is long enough to judge.",0,2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g,0,2,2011-08-22,review,2

It's because it's a groovy little place with young hipster (and some not so hipster) bartenders and waitresses that serves up an endless array of beers in a funky loud space.

Oh and they have a little quick chiller for the warm beers you grab in the back so you can drink them right away :-)

The food! Ok, I love the veggie dogs on the bun just plain, but I've been rockin' some of the specialty ones lately. I highly recommend the Chihuahua with jalapenos and avocado, or the Mac n' cheese, with...well, mac and cheese. The housemade root beer is also divine. It's perfectly sweet and refreshing. 

This isn't diet food people! There are far too many (oh so lovely) temptations at D's. Splurge and get the cheese fries to share. A small is good for 2 or 3 people and perfect with hotdogs.

Last time I went they had a variety of pumpkin beers and I pretty much tried them all to figure out which I liked best. If you aren't feeling any of the beers on tap then take a stroll to the walk in cooler in the back and take your pick of hundreds of bottles. Bring the one you like back to the bar and the bartender will open it for you and bring you a glass. 

The bartenders are really chill, and though the service isn't overly attentive, it is perfect for the vibe of D's. And speaking of the vibe, D's has this old pub style feel with the walls meeting at strange angles making cool little nooks and crannies where you can sit and sip your beer with friends or maybe just read a book.

D's is also known for their hot dogs, and while good and inventive, in my opinion are a little overpriced. For some reason I have trouble spending $5 for a hot dog. I've tried their wings and fries too, both good standard bar food, but again a tad overpriced. My friend and I drank beers (a good amount) and ordered food and our tab was $100.

If you are polite and civil and believe in not eating until everyone is served, well, let's just say that no one ever taught the manager, cooks or servers here that lesson.

I've lived in Pittsburgh for about 5 years now. I've been coming to D's for about 3...D's is one of the many gems of Regent Square.  It really is the place (if you go often enough) that everyone really does know your name....as well as what you like. Or in my case...the only beer I actually like enough to drink more than once.  The bartenders are all amazing people and really make you feel comfortable. The service is great and they are always ready with a recommendation for any newbies. All it takes is a few questions and they have a few suggestions. I have a friend who loves Magic Hat, and when finding out that D's didn't have it on tap that night, was totally bummed. When she told the bartender that she usually drinks MH, he made a recommendation. I was not at all surprised (she was) when she loved what he'd suggested. 

Your trip to D's wouldn't be complete without trying something from their extensive menu. Their hot dogs are great (and for those of you who are vegetarian, they have awesome veggie dogs), the pizza is delicious, and if you're craving wings, there's no better place to go (try the Jamaican jerk...they're my favorite!).

Okay, so you're thinking good beer, good food, good service, what more could they possibly offer?  DON'T LEAVE YET! Before you head home, hit the beer cave and take some to go. If you can't find something to drink here, you may just be too picky (or a non drinker, which is totally okay, but I would suggest the root beer they have on tap before you give up.) 

My sister and I stopped in over the weekend for some pizza. We had the pleasure of meeting Dino, the owner. He's incredibly friendly and just a nice guy ( he bought us both a drink!). We chatted for a bit, and he moved on to greet some other patrons. I think it says a lot about  any place when owners and employees alike can be found there on a day off. 

If you're visiting Pittsburgh and anywhere close (heck...even if you aren't close) head to D's and grab a taste of a great local bar",1,2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g,0,5,2011-11-26,review,1

Pints are $5-8 depening on how obscure a beer you are ordering.  But there is crazy selection.  Try something different.

The crew here managed to keep our glasses full even though it was packed on st. patrick's day.

We tried a few dogs: the mac and cheese brat (with bacon)....really! bacon, mac n cheese on an effin' hotdog, a bacon cheddar brat and something called the mason-dixon, which was french fries & coleslaw on a dog.  All the dogs were good eats.  You can get your order vienna, veggie, turkey, cheese brat, or on a spicy dog.  The dogs arrive well grilled with a little bit of crisp blackening going on.  There are a shit load of additional toppings you can request (avacado, bacon, various mustards, saurkraut, etc.) and they seemed to be free...at least we didn't get charged anything additional .....Everything was included in the dog prices.

Wings were ok.  We did dry wings: jerk, spicy ranch, and parmesean.  They were all decently meaty.  The parmeseans with a side of the spicy mayo were good stuff, distinct flavor and good for dipping.  The other flavors of dry wings were ok. Mostly just salty, but ok.",1,2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g,0,4,2012-03-18,review,2

Imagine if you will me sitting there and a myriad of punctuation marks pop up over my head as if I were in a cartoon.  My puzzlement showing because I have no sure shot way of how to accomplish eating this masterfully prepared awesomeness just sat down in front of me.

My mind was buzzing...or maybe that could  have been the raspberry ale I chosen from the beer cave prior to me sitting down.

Beers: usually a good variety on tap plus tons of variety if you need to one stop shop and pick some six packs up in the back. 

Warning though if it is a busy summer evening you can wait up to one hour for your dog I think this is because they have tiny kitchen behind the bar. So if you're super hungry go early or later or fill up on their beer first.

Went back for a visit to the alma mater and decided to stop in at D's before heading out. I have updates on the gluten-free beer situation and the nacho situation.

GF Beer: MUCH improved from what I remember. They had at least three varieties of the ""deglutenized"" beers - Estrella Damm Daura and both the Amber and Blonde Brunehaut (from Belgium!). They MAY have had Omission as well. 
They also have at least three varieties of New Planet, and at least two of Greens. Dogfish Head T'weasonale. Possibly New Grist and Tread Lightly? I was in a haze of deliciously non-gluteny beer at this point. 

Nachos: Maybe I'm recalling incorrectly, but I think when I've had these in the past they are made with real cheese - you know, shredded and melted. This time they were served with that nasty-ass liquid cheese goop, like you get at a ballpark. Blegh. 

Still four stars overall! Avoid the nachos though.

---

The only food I've ever had here is nachos, so I can't speak to that. I WILL speak to the beer selection, though! I've managed to collect quite an assortment of beer snob friends, who love spending hours (literally) in the Cave o' Beer. I have to eat gluten free, so most ordinary beers are off-limits for me, BUT, they have an enormous selection of hard cider! Many many different kinds, including my favorite cider in the whole world, JK Scrumpy. Totally reasonable prices, too.

Now the bad:
1. They close at midnight! After the downstairs closes you can take your drink upstairs to a little bar, but it's super loud, has no seating, and you don't have access to the magical treasure trove of beer. Boooo.
2. This is totally a niche thing, but I wish they had a better selection of gluten-free beers. There are lots of tasty ones out there, but they often only have Bards and Redbridge.",0,2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g,0,4,2012-12-11,review,0

What? I can't be the only one. Seriously? Fine. Then excuuuUUUuuuse me. I'll rephrase for the supposed masses.

If you enjoy eating hot dogs, you'll want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. It's a great place to go and get some tubed meat in a variety of different mix and match combinations and also a great place to meet new people... perhaps you'll even meet someone who shares your love of you eating hot dogs and you can shower them with many moments of which they can watch you eat your beloved wieners and y'all can live happily ever after. 

No? Ugh, fine. Then just eat the damn hot dog all by your lonesome. See if I care.

I came in with a group of friends for a semi-liquid lunch and though it was the beer cave that brought us in, I was secretly more excited about watching my friends eat hot dogs. You see, I'd been feeling super sick for the entire duration on my Pittsburgh road trip. I think it was a bad Cholera strain. Anyway, my party of six allowed me to sleep in extra late while they wandered around some graveyard by our hotel with scones until I was all puked out and ready see what the light of day looks like. I was feeling bummed that I had to hibernate through my original morning plan of going to the zoo, but the thought getting to see my pals suck down chili dogs all Jack & Diane style really helped lift my spirits.

We walked in, sat down and I was immediately excited to be sitting across from their epic celebrity mural. It's like a pop-culture/history 'Where's Waldo', only there's no Waldo, and instead Gandalf, Wolverine, John Candy, and more. I spent the entire time between ordering and the food coming out staring at the wall and finding new peeps. My only gripe on the artwork is that the mural was seriously lacking in Bill Murray biz-nasty, so for that I have to subtract a star. Okay, no. I'm only (half) joking about the star thing. I'm actually deducting the star because their veggie dog was pretty damn terrible. I mean, the toppings (I got the chihuahua with cheese and jalapenos) were fine, but I think I've microwaved dogs that tasted better than theirs. It was so freaking rubbery and tough and chewy... like bad calamari or trying to chew a whole pack of rock hard Bazooka Joe at once. My jaw was tired from trying to force my tearing teeth into that little soy sausage but the worst part is that I had to devote so much extra time to eating my stupid wiener that I missed being able to watch my friends eat their hot dogs. Boo-urns. Next time, I'll skip the veggie dog and go with a wrap or pizza or burger or something that'll allow for more wiener-peeping.

On the other hand, the veggie pub fries were damn good and something I resented having to offer to share them with my friends... but I did offer because I felt like it would detract from them getting 'weirded out' at my wanting to gawk at them like I bought a ticket to watch them eat hot dogs... even though that wishful thought didn't pan out anyway thanks to the lackluster veg-dog I ended up with. 

Their beer selection was stellar and their beer cave in back was a fun shopping experience and great place to find a few rarities. They actually had the Rogue Voodoo Doughnut bombers that you can hardly ever find. Unfortunately, my sickness impaired me from imbibing and I actually spent the latter half of the time there barfing in the bathroom (not to the fault of D's) while my friends shopped for a bevy of beer in the cave. Also worth mentioning is how friendly everyone here was. Lots of helpful staff members and even the other ladies in the bathroom who were concerned with my hurling to the point where they wouldn't leave me alone and I had to lie and say that it was no big deal, I was in my first trimester and the morning sickness was getting the best of me.

The restaurant itself has a cozy feel to it, and their large beer cave is one of the few places where I can get some of my favorite import beer.  Note, the Czechs make more than just Pilsner Urquell. Je to pravda! Most of the staff are very friendly, and the managers are always quick to help if you need assistance.  

Some of you may get angry with me, but I simply cannot review D's I without comparatively rating it against its sister restaurant, D's II in Monroeville.  And no, I couldn't possibly care less that the latter is in an old Pizza Hut.  That's right, I prefer D's II to D's I. Hear me out.  

First of all, D's I' drafts are all about a dollar more expensive than those in the suburbs.  Why the upcharge? 

Also, after being spoiled by the very large menu selection at D's II, I'm always a little disappointed when dining at Regent Square.  No wraps, no steak salad, no variety of sandwiches.  I will say that the food they do serve is good.  I enjoy their pizza and their daily hummus offering.  

D's I has a much smaller draft selection and lacks a full bar.  Fine.  It's a smaller location and it stays true to its original ""beer bar"" theme.  Sometimes, however, I like to mix it up.  And I can do that more easily at the Monroeville location.  Obviously, I's beer cave trumps II's beer... um... outcove? 

So all of that warrants a four-star rating.  Why the three? Like its suburban counterpart, I'm docking a star for closing so early.  Even when there is a crowd, the staff closes at 11:00 (Su-W) or 12:00 (Th-Sat) on the DOT.  That's just not responding to demand!

Overall, I don't dislike D's I.  Quite the contrary.  After all, three stars means ""A-OK.""  But to me, D's Regent Square doesn't go beyond that.",0,2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g,0,3,2012-12-29,review,0

So let's talk dogs first.  Each one is going to cost you $4-$5 and they are large, delicious and messy.  You definitely want to be among friends when you eat one of these bad boys and have plenty of napkins.  If you are only eating dogs, many folks order two.  Every topping imaginable is available.  Another popular choice is one dog and excellent fries.  Add a craft beer or two and you have one heck of a fine casual meal.

Speaking of craft beers, the selection here is excellent.  I appreciate that the names are up on an easy to read board that includes the ABV%.  If you are new to craft beers, many of them are very strong.  Let's say you normally drink three or four Coors Lights and now you are discovering the pleasure of Delirium Noel.  It's a 10% beer and if you drink three or four you are in for a big surprise!  In the interest of safe driving for everyone, be aware of the ABV%.

If that isn't enough to get you stop by D's then you're missing the point and probably shouldn't anyhow.",0,2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g,0,5,2013-02-04,review,1

Ds did not disappoint: creative craft beer list of 25+ taps, plus hundreds of bottles in the Beer Cave that you can have onsite or take to-go, and some of the best dogs I've ever had. Was there on a Friday, so got the Scorpion (cheddar jalapeno kielbasi) & fries deal for $5.50--excellent. Also tried the very good Ds Brat (cheesy bratwurst) & fries (same price), and they do a terrific version of the Chicago Dog. There are also 20+ toppings options if you want to DIY. Nice, friendly service from the guys behind the bar/in the kitchen made this a fine time.

Next time I'm in PGH, Ds will be at the top of my list to visit. Can't wait to try their other dogs and whatever they have on tap (or in the Cave).

Regular dog, beef dog and veggie dog.  You have unlimited toppings - mushrooms, onions, creamy avocado etc.  The dog came in this little boat sized paper tray.  I find it very hard to eat because all of the toppings would fall off to the table, but they do have paper towels for you to put underneath if you want to do this so you can eat whatever falls off.

the beer selection is massive! 

Being from Michigan, we are spoiled with craft beers from our fine state, but with that comes the desire to try other state's craft beer selection and D's had a solid selection of PA brews.  

For one, the beer cooler had a good sized selection, but it's all about the hundreds of warm beers they have in the back of the restaurant.  They have pretty much anything you want back there and it doesn't' matter that it's warm because they have a beer chiller where you can put your beers in there until optimal temperature.   It only takes about 7 minutes and they are good to go as well.

3795,E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA,pEzXjz2MsAs5VMNvrqQpnQ,"D'z is hands down my favorite go to spot for good eats. I love their wings and their hot dogs. 
Everytime I go there i am greeted with fun young employees ready to serve or offer suggestions about their latest brews. Their draft list changes constantly so there's no sense in trying to remember which beer you had there the week before. Plus their beer cave is great with hundreds of different bottles to choose from all listed by the region from which they came. They also have a small cooler with about 150 different varieties of beer that are already chilled for your liking. Even if you get a warm beer, they have this ice cold dunk tank to put your bottle in that gets it nice and chilly for you in just a few minutes. That by far is my favorite aspect of D'z. If you choose to take beer home with you they also have a discount of $1.00 per bottle of every beer you take with you(excluding the pre-made six packs). So sometimes we get a six pack of variety beers at a lower cost than paying for them individually. On to the food:

I love their wings and hot dogs and my masterful veggie burger creation. We always order the BBQ sauce because it taste so gooooood and their wings are nice and crispy and hot and smothered in plenty of sauce that you will be licking your fingers. We've tried almost all their dogs expect 2 and my favorite is the mac and cheese dog(w/ ketchup) and the chihuahua dog which is avocado, shredded cheddar cheese and jalapenos, my fiance enjoys a classic Chicago dog. The have delicious sauerkraut that i enjoy as well so i usually get a side for only 99 cents. Can't beat that price. Now when it comes to the veggie burger i love the way it taste. I do it up real nice by getting that black n blue topping which is blue cheese and cajun seasoning. I add bacon, onion, mushrooms, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their spicy mayo/double dip sauce. It is hands down the best burger i've ordered in a loooong time. 

If your looking for a fun hangout spot for you and your buddies or even a tasty treat for the kids then D'z is where it's at!!! It gives you the feeling of just a fun place to be on the weekend or even the weekdays. 

Due to an unfortunate circumstance of eating at a different hotdog shop during restaurant week, my fiance would have proposed to me at D'z.

I was intrigued by the specials menu so I started with an order of wings and Buffalo wing hummus.  This Buffalo girl was pleased.  The wings were tasty and done perfectly.  And the hummus was so good I wanted to ask for the recipe.  

The flavor combinations of the hot dogs were crazy.  Who would ever think of putting pineapples and bacon on a hot dog?  Well, I'm glad they did.  It was an interesting mix of flavors and was very satisfying.  If I hadn't also tried the wings and hummus, I would have tried at least two other hot dog creations.

Had Helltown's Reaper Harvest Ale last night and it was fabulous. I've had quite a few local brews here as well as a selection of other crafts. I love having exciting draft beer choices!

The food is really good too! Wings, dogs, veggie dogs...these aren't just your typical ballpark quality dogs. Nah, these are amazing. The buns, the all beef dog with that welcome ""snap"" when you bite it...yum. Plus the selection of options will keep you coming back to try more and more. The daily specials are worth watching - the 10 wings for $5 on Monday is a bargain!!

Since they don't serve cheapo food or beer, the price reflects that. 2 draft beers and 2 hotdogs  is close to $25. But hey, enjoy it.

the first i had heard of d's was their six pack shop. they have a large selection of room-temp, cold, domestic, craft, import, normal-size, giant bottles that you can make your own 6 pack with. this was the first place i had ever been to with those kind of options, but now i realize (here's why one star is taken off) the prices for 6 packs are not nearly as wonderful as the selection. now, obviously, with mixed bottles, the price will go up, especially if you have expensive kinds in there. but it seems they charge full price per bottle, which is a pretty lousy deal in the end.
but prices for eat/drink-in are totally acceptable! in fact, i don't believe i had ever eaten at d's until a recent yelp event. their hot dogz are FANTASTIC and i only had a beef dog with sauerkraut, not exactly anything fancy. i also got to sample their hummus and dry-rub bbq wings, both of which were also super tasty.
the service is always really friendly here too. there's plenty of room to sit down (bar, table, ""loft"" upstairs with a bar and a few tables). and there's even darts upstairs, too.

As a vegetarian who still likes to pretend to eat meat, I so appreciate their multiple veggie options. Nearly any item on the menu can be made in a vegetarian version. Their special dogs (dog of the month) are usually a lot of fun. My favorite was the Thanksgiving dog back in November, with corn, mashed potatoes, cranberry, and stuffing. It was amazing! I came twice to have one in November. 

Their beer list has to be the best I've seen in the city. Lots of great stuff on tap and a huge bottle room.

Their vegan dog on a poppy seed bun comes with unlimited toppings, for just 4.99!

After squeezing into a parallel parking spot out front, I had two things on my mind when walking in here: hotdogs and beer, both of which they have down pat.

Since it was mid-afternoon, few tables were filled, but the front patio was open to allow in some fresh air during the nice day. I first looked around at their extensive beer selections; ""six pax"" in the rear ""Beer Cave"" and individual bottles in the middle cooler. I found something to my liking and grabbed a high table and menu.

A ""Big Ben"" dog sounded appetizing (and mildly appropriate), but I ended up going with the ""Mason Dixon"" topped with chili and coleslaw. Knowing that one dog would not be enough, I also went with a small order of their ""Pub Fries"" covered in cheese and bacon. (Forgive me Father, for I have no restraint.)

Holy Moley! Both the dog and fries were excellent and down right tasty. Thank God because my satisfied stomach was smacking down the guilty part of my brain that was subconsciously calculating the summation of calories shared between the meal and two bottles of liquid refreshment.

Boyfriend and I and a group of friends were in Pittsburgh for the weekend, and I found D's on yelp.  The hot dogs looked delicious, and my friends are real beer fans, so we thought it'd be perfect.  It was better than expected.  

First, obviously, the beer selection is amazing. You can either order off their menu, choose a beer from their walk-in fridge, or venture back into the Beer Cave (where they've got every beer ever) and throw a bottle or too in the chiller.  Five minutes later, the beer's cold and delicious. We all took advantage of this, and picked up six packs on the way out.  

Second, the hot dogs were really good. I definitely recommend the Angry Tiki dog.  Sweet, spicy and really delicious. 

The only thing is they don't handle groups well. There's plenty of room, but once we'd already split up our check amongst everyone's credit card, we were told they don't usually do that for more than 6 people.  The guy did it for us anyway, but it took awhile, and I'm still not really sure who got charged for what.

I suppose maybe I was expecting too much, which led to some disappointment. A few friends and I went here on a Friday night and it was (predictably) packed. We were fairly lucky to get a table almost right away. 

I obviously had to acknowledge that the beer selection is impressive. If you can't find it here, you probably can't find it anywhere in Pittsburgh. I had to check out the famous ""Beer Cave"" which seemed to have just about everything. I think I'll make it a point to pick up some brews here next time I'm looking for something unusual or new.

We each ordered a sandwich. Their menu wasn't large but they had more than just your typical bar food, definitely more interesting items. I got a chicken sandwich named the chihuahua--chicken, avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa and jalapeños. It was amazing! Their sandwiches automatically come with chips (which I'm never a fan of) but I was able to substitute them for French fries. Their fries were amazing, they were the kind that are battered and those are my favorite (very few places around the burgh sell them like that) so this was very exciting to me. Overall the price isn't bad either which was awesome. After dinner my boyfriend and I both go my 6 packs to go.. They have an awesome selection..

When I first moved to Pittsburgh, a local clued me in to the wonders of D's. She leaned forward and whispered, ""....yeah 'suchandsuchbar' is alright, but if you want the BEST beer selection in Pittsburgh with the friendliest staff, go to D's Six Pax and Dogz."" 

She proceeded to give me directions. Mind you, this was a total stranger. But I liked the mystique so obviously I jumped in my car and found D's (her directions were perfect.) 

Walking into the beer cave is an almost religious experience. What's this to my immediate left? Seasonal brews? Yes, I'll definitely have some of those. Trippel Belgians? Count me in. Beers brewed by monks? Of course. All the Dogfish Head and Rogue a girl could ever want? Double check. Giant bottles of Chimay? I must be dreaming. And if you thought things couldn't get any better, you're clearly not following along close enough-you get $1.00 off every bottle you take to go. 

Bobby and I brought a friend here last night because he said he had never been. We stocked up on pumpkin beers and they even had Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale which I can never seem to find anywhere. Our friend was in awe. The only downside I can possibly think of when it comes to D's is the magical time powers that seem to exist in the beer cave. I kid you not, I've sometimes found myself in the beer cave for over 45 minutes agonizing over crafting the perfect six pack. Of course, this isn't D's fault. I'm naturally indecisive.

We sat down at the bar, and the bartender refused to even acknowledge us, let alone serve us.  So we switched to the other side of the space.

The service on the other side was better but a tad slow.  I started with the macaroni and cheese ($3.00).  It was just doctored Kraft mac and cheese, with a bit too much salt, but for the price is was reasonable and good.  I ordered a Chicago dog ($5.50), and the hot dog was an all star for the most part.  It was an authentic Chicago style dog, and the toppings were fantastic.  My friend ordered a Big Ben hot dog, and it was pretty gross.  The cheese picked up the vinegar-y taste from the coleslaw, and it made the cheese taste sour.  Not appetizing at all.  

D's grills their hot dogs, which is normally fine.  However, both my friend and my dogs came out very burnt.  One of hers was literally inedible, and these hot dogs are pricey.  The server did not say anything about the practically untouched hot dog and just took it off of the table.

They do have some daily or lunch specials for cheaper hot dogs so check that out.

About the place:
- It's small
- It's packed and crowded.
- Due it's size, they seats near the walls are all awkward and can't be comfortable.
- I wouldn't recommend it for big parties unless you organized it with the place ahead of time.
- There is free parking outside, but you are going to have trouble finding a space

The food:
- NOTHING COMES WITH THE HOT DOGS AND MEALS COME WITH CHIPS. The fries cost more to get as a side. Who ever heard of fries with your burger/dog? Um, apparently everyone except this place.
- I got the chili cheese dog, the mac and cheese dog and the chili cheese fries.
- The chili cheese fries are very very good and are some of the best I've had. If you like long fries with breading, you'll like these. The large size is indeed a large size and is enough for 2-3 people.
- You get one hot dog, and with toppings on it, it will cost $6.50. I get two dogs with toppings at the local Sunoco for $2.22. I could also buy two packs of hot dogs and probably buns from a cheap place for $6.50, so it's not the cheapest.
- The hot dog buns are good and have some green or black seeds on it. The hot dogs are just typical size and aren't super fat or foot longs.

The staff:
- They are overworked but they are nice.
- One of the girls was cooking and had no hair cover, so I could easily see hair going in food. Hope they fix that.

Suggestions for D's:
- Please sell curly fries or pretzels!
- Stop being cheap. Give fries with your burger/dog and GIVE ME A SIDE WITH MY DOG.
- Try to get a bigger place
- Lower the prices for hot dogs or give two hot dogs. They have to be making near $6 profit on a $6.50 dog.

The show room is upstairs, but you would never know it from the drab, basement-like entrance. As I walked up the stairs I notices ZERO customers in the store, however; two employees were working on the sales floor.

The owner did not respond to me for, at least, 10 minutes even though the store was empty and another employee was just walking around ""dusting"" (the store smalls like the inside of a mascot costume).

When the owner, finally, saw me she made a little annoying noise like ""What the hell are YOU doing here!!"". She walked over slowly, like a zombie looking for fresh brains and giving a crap why I was there. She asked me to follow her as she took me downstairs to an absolutely empty storeroom (by that I mean: what was she doing that was was so important that she couldn't wait on a customer) and took her sweet-ass time to get the dress which, by the way, was a second alteration. You see, they screwed up the first time they altered the dress (even after my wife tried it on there and markings or whatever were made!). So everyone is entitled to a mistake even a business that claims perfection; it's important to give them a chance to redeem themselves. But, to my surprise, she handed me a bill for the second alteration!!!!!! Are you kidding me?!!!

I argued a bit, but then gave in; what was I supposed to do? We were leaving to go 200 miles away the next day for the wedding. So I paid. Do not go here ladies!

Monday afternoon I stopped by and was told the suit wouldn't be there until 5:00PM. When I insisted that I had been told morning, she went into the back and came out with what I first thought was the suit but turned out to be only the jacket. She told me to come back after 5:00PM. When I asked to speak with the manager, she informed me that she was the only person there. I asked her to have the manager call me - she said the manager wouldn't answer the phone and reiterated the 5:00PM time when the last delivery came and petulantly informed me that none of this was her fault.

At 5:30PM I called and was told that the last delivery hadn't come yet and I'd have to call later. I again asked them to have the manager call me and she told me she couldn't give me the manager's phone number - which I hadn't asked for. I was again told this wasn't her fault. As of 7:00PM, the delivery finally arrived but not my pants.

I was told the manager would call me after she arrived in the morning. I finally called at 9:00AM and was criticized by the manager for demanding her home phone number and told that there was never any guarantee about when clothes would be returned even when a rush was placed on them. 

Apparently a *lot* of clothes were missing from the Monday delivery so I wasn't the only person upset about this situation.

When I told them they'd lost my business for good, I was told that was fine and hung up on, forcing me to call again to find out exactly *when* I might be able to expect my missing pants.

There's a fancy back bar that remains closed so that two bartenders can roost on top of each other like Master/Blaster in Beyond Thunderdome and watch TV.  This kind of forces patrons to hover near the front.  So, uh, invest in a second TV, a nice coat of paint, maybe some dimmer light bulbs.  You know, gussy yourself up a bit Murphy's.

3878,UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA,aBl7K8yJ_2mJyoOaqq6bQw,"After reading a majority of the prior reviews of this place, I feel like I should get out the soapbox again, because some of you should be ashamed of yourselves.  Especially the one that never stepped foot inside.  I mean how do you write a review of a place you NEVER experienced.  And all the complaining about the smoke...get used to it.  What did you do years ago when people were allowed to smoke wherever they went?  Yes, I know it's a nuisance.  Yes, I am a smoker myself, but I have enough common sense to be a polite smoker (this is my personal choice, and it is your personal choice not to smoke, as it is a business' choice to allow or not allow smoking in its establishment).

Anyway, let's move forward.  I was skeptical of this place long before ever reading reviews, and long before I discovered Yelp.  The outside of the bar looks old, which may have been a factor in deterring me for so long.  It looks like it would be a one room tiny bar, but looks are deceiving, it is actually a big space.

The front is a typical barroom.  The bar takes up a good part of the room.  But there is a fair amount of space for people to walk about freely when going to the door.  Behind the bar is a small seating area where there are bar stools.  In the back of the place they appear to have just about everything you would expect a bar to have.  Pool table, multiple dart boards, and I even believe a shuffleboard table.  I cannot speak of how it is in the back as I only glanced on my way to the bathroom.  The bathroom I had used however, was rather small.  Just enough room for you to do your business and turn around to wash your hands.

The staff here on the particular night I attended were polite, funny and nice to chat with.  They were knowledgeable about the brews on tap and every beer they had in stock.  The drinks, by the way, were truly amazing.  Just the right mixture of everything when they made up your drink of choice.  And just to make sure you were enjoying the drink, the bartender came back around and asked if it was to your liking.  The bartender even made sure it wasn't too strong and offered to add to the drink to balance it better.

As for the limited food they had to offer, I cannot really talk about.  The food I did see that patrons ordered looked palatable, so on my next visit I might give it a try.  I have to say, that any place that offers popcorn for $.25 is alright by me (better than having it sitting on the bar and you have no idea who has put their hands in there).",0,7lDNKKxMV84KIS1OVZOepw,1,4,2013-12-09,review,1

I was given an estimate and paid on time in full - not sure when this changed or why I was never told by the office or insurance company.  Regardless, I called over 5 times to discuss a payment plan with the office.  When I first emailed them, I was told I could choose the amount with which I wanted to pay to cover the amount owed.  Then, I was told my amount was too low and would get a call back.  NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.  I was very upset.  I emailed, and called so many times.

It's great that it's freshly hand battered, but they seem to have forgotten something -- the FLAVOR. This stuff had no seasoning on it at all, so we have to pour on a generous helping of salt to get it to taste like anything. And for $8 that's disappointing.

We each ordered burgers. At $10 a pop I was expecting a nice juicy burger. What I got was dry and totally tasteless. The whole burger just tasted like nothing. Perhaps their salt shaker fell on the floor and rolled under the fridge or something tonight. It was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries. Again NO SALT OR SEASONING. For a $40 night out I really shouldn't have to dump salt all over everything I order. 

The service...meh. Our server was so meek I could barely hear her. Serving takes a bit of personality, no? When we asked what the happy hour specials were, she said ""Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....it depends on the drink."" What? What does that mean?

I met my friend Jean here, she is a once a week customer. Lucky her living on Biddle Street, she lunches daily at different eateries on Braddock ave. One day the Square Cafe (read my review), one day the Map Room, another day D's Packs n Dogs. 

Looking over the menu, my choices were limited to a veggie wrap or salads. I chose a veggie wrap, sans cheese with a side of apple sauce. The wrap was nothing special, mushrooms, spinach, lettuce, tomato, and a side of canned applesauce.

Jean had a buffalo chicken wrap and iced tea. She complained the tea was weak, I never noticed. She said he wrap was good, a chicken breast fried, then drenched in buffalo chicken sauce, then drenched in blue cheese dressing and wrapped in a flour tortilla. 

Dunnings is nothing special, it's a long time establishment that gets by on regulars. This day, the most I saw in the place was 9 people in the bar and dinning room.

3896,sYonLXU0zgZGGaRDJRPxXw,-ZNdeMPDxeBYdnHSJeiyGg,"I live in Regent Square and have been to Dunning.s about a half-dozen times over the past several years.  It was never a great restaurant, in fact, it was never even an average restaurant.  At best, the food was mediocre, and the only time that I would eat here was when I was too tired to get in my car and travel the three or so miles to the Union Grill in Oakland (which offers similar fare as Dunning.s - and does an incomparably better job of it).

Recently, however, things have taken a nosedive at Dunning's.  I now consider Dunning's to be the single worst restaurant in the city that I've ever had the misfortune of entering.  

I recently had the worst restaurant service experience of my life at Dunning's when our waitress first ignored our party, then hurried us through our order, then left us sit for over 20 minutes waiting for food with empty drinks.  We then received terrible food (soggy sandwiches, brown lettuce in a salad, and cold french fries - stone cold), and when we complained about our fries, the waitress launched into an angry tirade (nearly yelling at us) about how it wasn't her fault, that she just picks up the food, and that there wasn't anything she could do about it.  When I asked to speak to the manager, he just shook his head sadly and offered us free desserts.  I told him that I didn't want to eat anything that came out of a kitchen that clearly showed that the people working in it simply didn't care - at all, and we didn't want to eat anything, not even the food sitting in front of us, and just wanted to pay our bill and leave.  He said that he was going to ""comp"" our meal.  

It was a disastrous experience - the single worst restaurant experience of my life - and I will never return until the restaurant is under new management.  It is crystal-clear that the current manager and/or owner isn't doing his job, and I cannot understand how anyone would choose to spend their hard-earned money at this establishment when virtually every other restaurant in town offers far better service and food.  

In short: no one - not the manager, not the waitresses, not the cooks - cares about the customer.  Not at all.",0,XQ7elqSFIRogvqpiTZz-Wg,0,1,2011-08-16,review,5

I beg to differ. I always have great, prompt service and the same window seat every time I come here. Then again, I always come in the middle of the afternoon and only order one drink and the French Onion Soup. However I have had dinner here before.

I like Dunnings because it is not tying to be anything other than an old school, family friendly, bar-restuarant. It is a Regent Square staple, and the folks that come here seem to be staples as well. There is a Cheers vibe (early 80's sitcom
about a Boston bar where ""everyone knows your name"") and that seems to fare very well with the local residents. After living in Los Angeles for all of my 20's, I find this kind of environment comforting and  refreshing.

For the life of me, I cannot remember what I had for dinner here. I guess that may be a testament to the mediocre food.

So, if you are looking for a low key, mellow, old school (dark wood, framed pictures of landscapes a'la Rembrandt) place to check out, have a casual drink and appetizer, Dunnings is your spot.   I feel bad that the previous folks had crappy service, but if you come here with an open mind and the correct expectations, you will love this place as much as I do.

I highly recommend anything fried or on a bun from Dunnings, you will not be disappointed.   When it comes to the dinner selections, I think it just depends on the cook in the kitchen.

They also carry some vintage jewelry, scarves and handbags.

I've always been promising myself I'd stop in here sometime.  So f-i-n-a-l-l-y I was able to get my butt in here & do some serious thrifting.

Ambiance Boutique is not like any other thrift store.  They don't sell crap here.  You won't find any Kmart knock off brands.  And if you take a close look at their website, you'll notice they are v-e-r-y picky about what they accept http://www.ambianceboutique.org/html/documents/consignment.pdf http://www.ambianceboutique.org/html/faq.html
But this totally benefits the consumer.  You'll find a lot of great high end, gently used brands here.  You'll also find that this store is clean 'n' bright, well organized, and the sales staff here really knows their stuff.

What's truly wonderful about Ambiance is it's part of Bethlehem Haven.  Bethlehem Haven is an organization that provides services to homeless women, giving them housing and teaching them life skills in order to be self sufficient.  I'm all about vintage wear, thrifting, and reusing still-viable goods.  And if by doing so I'm supporting a valuable charity, so much the better.

Well the upshot was I didn't quite find what I was looking for.  I wanted some spring and summerwear, particularly sundresses and halter tops.  But I came away with a nice gently used Michael Kors brown leather bag and a sweet men's Polo button down shirt.  No, it's not for Rick.  It's for me!

The store employee happily accepted all of my items- until the next day when I received a call that the owner rejected half of the items. This was the third time I consigned with Ambiance in Oakmont, and I only offered items that I thought were in excellent condition from high end retailers; even though I have seen brands in the store from Charter Club for example (Ambiance says they do not accept them in the consigning agreement). The employee was very apologetic and she said that she stood by her assessment that the items were of good quality, but the owner (who she seemed upset with) disagreed. So, get your stuff together Ambiance owner and either train your employees better, or only accept items yourself so that you do not inconvenience potential customers like me.

I went here midday on a Sunday.  Thought that was a great idea, especially when I got there and there were no cars in the drive thru.  Pull up to the sign to order and wait for five minutes before I am even acknowledge that I am there.  Finally order and pull around, I wait another five minutes.

We just moved to Pittsburgh in July, and before we got the interwebs in our home, we would frequent Katerbean fairly regularly, at least 2 to 3 times per week in order to use their free wi-fi and have a drink.  Every time... EVERY TIME we went there, we left reeking of smoke.  There's no smoking inside, of course, but it always happened.  Maybe it's due to poor ventilation, or the fact that the employees were regularly outside smoking, but we always left smelling like we were in a bar.

Then, the tables were usually dirty.  When we would order our drink, we would usually have to get ourselves a napkin, wet it, and wipe our table ourselves. Not surprising, as most of the employees I've encountered there (with the exception of the very nice older woman) seemed pretty put out when I asked for anything.

Yes, the place smells. A good carpet scrubbing would work, but tearing it up would be much better. The coffee is a step up from foldgers. The soy milk tastes like whole milk. Tables are often dirty.

I go there because sometimes it's convenient, b/c of the location, but last week they left their A/C broken for over a week (in 80+ degree weather).  No additional fans, nothing.

Then when it was fixed, I went in, ordered coffee and an order of hummus/carrot/celery (prepackaged).  Not only was the hummus watery from sitting in that container for several days, but the celery was rotting at the ends, yes brown and rotting.  I showed the kid working there, who was probably jonesing to have his next cigarette, and I asked for another one.  Without opening it I could see at least 2-3 of the other servings of hummus were also all watery and had celery that was starting to rot, just like the one I was given.  I asked for my money back.  You know what was the worst thing, though?  The kid (he knows nothing about customer service let alone food service) put the containers with the watery, rotting celery back in the case, to serve to other unsuspecting customers!

Regent Square deserves a better coffee shop, run by someone with good business sense.  What kind of a ""business"" only prepares food (chicken/tuna salad, hummus) once a week?  Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge?  Also, whenever they lose an employee, they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months.  They should be open till 10 pm as it is, with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially in the summer. My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door.   Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the place!

BTW, Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect, but the place to this day reeks of stale smoke.

Added note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted.  I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition.

This place has been here for years, and as I sit drinking my bitter, bitter coffee, and smelling the overwhelming scent of (I believe) dog pee, I wonder how it's even possible.  

The three times I've been here, I'm greeted as if I'm a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent.  They always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if I am terrifying to them, then duck out of the way.  Then grudgingly come when I peek around the counter at them.  If I didn't, I'm convinced that they would just sit there, as if they're not certain of what position they hold in this place, or what the next step should even be.  This is what I like to call, ""The Dance of Shitty Customer Service.""  

Today (and I write this longingly looking over at Square Cafe) I decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded, and I figured the quiet would be a good thing.  The girl at the counter was on the phone, and that's the way it stayed for two minutes until I said 'excuse me?'.  The charming reply: ""Yeah?"" She grudgingly got off the phone, and after accomplishing the Herculean task of handing me a cup, I pumped this swill that I'm currently drinking.

She's currently muttering under her breath back in her corner.  I'm not sure if maybe she's having a bad day, or she's just an asshole, but...if I had to bet, I'm going with asshole.

This place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is, and the food...Just don't eat the food.  

(side note: this place isn't quiet at all when somebody orders something.  She stomps around like she's being sent to her room.  Then continues muttering)

Okay, so this place is a travesty.  Bad coffee, bad odor, bad lighting, unbelievably bad, grudging service.  I would beg the owners to put any effort into this place.

The kid at the counter was nice enough, so service was not an issue. The atmosphere inside pretty much sucks though...and you have to work pretty hard to make a cute little neighborhood coffee shop have zero atmosphere. 

The first thing you see when you walk in a sign alerting you of the ""RULES"": to not use your cell phone at the counter, and that you must pay for something to sit inside, use the restrooms, or use the WiFi. Now, I understand the sentiment of these rules, they are common sense and fair. But it's a rather negative note to start off your experience being yelled at by a sign assuming you are there to steal their interwebz. It just doesn't feel warm or welcoming somehow. The front counter is poorly organized and rather unattractive. If it ever gets busy in there I'm willing to bet it gets rather chaotic.

I ordered an iced vanilla latte, so I was quite surprised when the kid pulls out a pitcher from the fridge of what I can only guess was refrigerated espresso. That was rather disappointing; there's no reason an iced latte shouldn't be prepared with fresh espresso shots. Not surprisingly, it tasted bitter like...old espresso. Then I finished the drink to find the cup was 90% full of ice. I mean, come on. My lemon almond biscotti was delicious. The rest of the offerings in the pastry case appeared pretty underwhelming though; standard prepackaged muffins and cookies. With the number of excellent bakeries in this area, I don't see why they couldn't partner up with someone to provide some higher quality foods.


I think this place could learn a lot from Square Cafe as far as decor and atmosphere go. It needs a little pep, a little warmth, SOMETHING. And they need to learn how to make iced lattes correctly. And they could also use an upgrade on their website...it's pretty amateurish and has a 1992 flair... Basically they just need to show a little effort.

I grew up with one place right around the corner from me and had to learn to love another place when I moved out of Pittsburgh. So when I returned to the 'burgh too far away from my favorite, I was anxious to find a good delivery place close by.

Veltre's has proven themselves to me over and over again. Their pizza sauce is better than the place I grew up with and the crust is always nice and chewy.

As to the calzone - it's now a staple in my home. Lots of filling, excellent cheeses and the sauce is just about the tastiest I've ever had. Also, I'm vegetarian and my mother can't eat red sauce. No problem - Veltre's makes it for me with no sauce inside and a container of marinara sauce on the side. The people there are always very accommodating.

A large is big enough for three people with leftovers for one more serving. Some friends came over one night and we ordered four large - two meatball, one chicken and one of my favorite - spinach and mushroom.

My friends only managed to finish one out of the three they'd ordered (the meatball) and decided it was better than the calzone at Monte Cello's - a restaurant they'd been going to for over fifteen years.

As to delivery time, I generally order a little later than standard dinner time and I've rarely waited more than 45 minutes for my order. The one time they forgot something, it took only about ten minutes for the driver to pick it up and drop it off.

Another reason why I like shopping here is that it's not crowded like other department stores, so I can shop in peace.

Not one, but two of the registers I stood in line at froze, and the women had to wait for the manager to fix.  They didn't seem to mind at all, which leads me to believe this happens all of the time.

3993,yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q,i0O-aiyy6rF-xf_1x6QTlg,"Oh, American fast food chains.  How large your portions.  How nostalgic you are.

We were the proud owners of a gift card to Applebee's (Christmas gift!) and the best part of this gift was my boyfriend's reaction to me later.  He has never been to an Applebee's.  Or an Olive Garden.  Or a Chili's.  His first time at a Red Lobster was with me when we were stuck in a strip mall hell for the night.  So he's new to these restaurants, which so many of us grew up with.  I'd only been to an Applebee's a handful of times, but I was down to go back - it seems like they sort of have everything, no matter what you're hungry for.

Since we're spending all our time now packing to move back to Chicago (WOOHOO!), we don't always have time to make dinner.  So we busted out the Applebee's gift card and journeyed to Edgewood Towne Center for some chain restaurant foods.  

When we arrived, this server really awkwardly asked us to sit at the bar.  I missed the finer points of the interaction, since he was talking to my boyfriend, but he basically insinuated that he'd just sat some large tables, or something, and it was his turn to have a table in his section but he didn't have the time to serve us, or something, and he didn't want us to wait (for what, I'm not sure) so he was basically like ""Can you sit at the bar?""  Which was weird because there were like, at least a dozen open tables.   But whatevs.  The cool kids sit at the bar, and we are the cool kids.

Chuck, the bartender, was running this show.  Dude.  He was on top of everything.  Taking orders, serving drinks, answering phones, getting takeout orders, keeping his bar neat and tidy - he was HOPPING!  We were both in awe just watching him.  That man is earning his tips, for reals.  So I'd recommend sitting at the bar if Chuck is working.  He's also cute, so bonus there.  The Applebee's bar is kind of a hilarious place - random people having drinks as if it's a real bar and not a restaurant, this one lady READING A BOOK WITH A GLASS OF WINE like it was some fancy cafe, some annoying fratty people....and us.  A healthy mix.

I had a Shock Top and my boyfriend had a Sam Adams - mad props for Shock Top on draft, not expecting that from Applebee's.  We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, which I believe was half price (as are all apps) during happy hour.  It was served with regular tortilla chips (like from a bag) but the dip itself was pretty tasty.  It was served in a really wide but shallow crock, and tasted appropriately spinachy and cheesy.  It was served very hot and was pretty satisfying!

My side salad arrived shortly thereafter, and it was amusingly huge for a side.  Iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, crispy croutons, shredded cheese, tangy bottled Italian dressing on the side.  I bought it to balance out my entree, but somehow these iceberg lettuce salads never really feel healthy, you know? Like eating crispy water.  With cheese and croutons.  YAY HEALTH!

Then came the entrees - I got an order of wings (which I think is technically listed as an appetizer) with ""Sweet and Spicy Sauce"" which was listed as the second-hottest sauce on the menu.  They were pretty decent - served hot, juicy chicken, and the sauce was sweet and sticky.  It was a little *too* sweet for me - picture gloopy Chinese takeout in sweet sticky sauce, and that's what the wing sauce was like - but it still made a satisfying meal.  My boyfriend got one of their ""special burgers"" from their new New Orleans menu -something like a Bourbon Bacon burger.  They asked him ""pink or no pink"" which we thought was funny.  He said ""pink,"" and the burger came out with like, a tiny touch of maybe-pink in the middle.  Medium-rare, this ain't!  He said it was okay.  Not great.  Just a burger.  I didn't taste it, I just nibble on a few of his fries, which were pretty average.

That all came in at around $30, aided greatly by the happy hour appetizer discount.  I have no interest in going to Applebee's again because I can get better burgers, pasta, chicken, bar food, everything, etc anywhere else, but if I was road tripping and needed a place to stop, this wouldn't be a bad choice.  Sit at the bar and hope Chuck is there, and enjoy pretty average versions of American bar food.",0,h3la53L9-OX_HlfeAySh0Q,0,3,2012-03-01,review,0

He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak.

Sooo... if you're a fan of Teppanyaki, this review may ring familiar. If you've not done Teppan style before... consider this a sort of ""what to look for"" primer.

There were five of us, sharing our table with a very nice young, near-newlywed couple; May 2010. Our table wait time, without a reservation, was about 35 minutes or so. (maybe they were waiting for a newlywed couple to join us?). And what lengthened the wait was the understaffed bar. We waited nearly 10 minutes to see a bar-server, and another 15 minutes to get our drink order. While everyone was friendly and apologetic, even apologies get old when they're used to salve away exceedingly slow service. Maybe the reason they appear to be busy, even on a Wednesday night.......? They had an abundance of tables celebrating ""Birthdays."" I'd guess I listened to at least twelve renditions of ""Happy Birthday"", sung by the ""Greentree-Benihana-Bday Choir!"" (Oi vay...... next time I'm bringing earplugs!)   :-))

My impression? This is Pittsburgh; not my destination for ""great Japanese cuisine."" So while this fine city certainly has some excellent eateries, when it comes to chain or franchised restaurants, you have to compare each location to the balance of their nation-wide organization. And having eaten at Teppan style restaurants for many years, and many Benihanas, I'd have to grade this particular location in the ""C"" range; very average.

Before we were seated, and while we were waiting in the bar, I spied the dining room. It appeared all the chefs were slow, seemingly ackward with their knives. And almost comically so. One Anglo chef, (no offense to Scandinavians that dream of becoming a Teppan-Guru), well, this guy looked like it was his first night, cutting off the shrimp tails...... almost one at a time, and still having a problem!? I think you get the idea. I've seen some Teppan-knife wielders, line up the shrimp and with one long swipe... de-tail-a-fy 30 with one stroke! Not here... some of the chefs may be on ""beginner knife-speed restriction?""

As one reviewer mentioned; ""...it depends on which chef you get at your table."" And with Teppanyaki style restaurants, and especially Benihanas, it's very true. It shouldn't be like that, but here in Greentree, and the evening we went, (Wednesday night around 630p), it was like going to a ""Barber College"" to get a free haircut, and trying to figure out how to judge the best out of a group of ""beginners."" Our chef was possibly the best of the crowd, (sounds like... ""You have to go to my doctor, he's the best!""), but if compared to all the Benihanas I've visited, he too would be a C to C- level; maybe a ""brown belt"" in marshall arts vernacular? He did the ""flip shrimp tail into the hat and pocket trick""..... finally making it on the third try. But he did smile throughout the demo. (A good attitude is worth allot in my book.)

The food? Pretty good. Essentially, we ordered ""everything on the right side of the menu""... mainly because I was treating my customer service staff... the greatest asset I have for my sales region. And because one of them had never Teppanyak-eed, I made sure we tried everything! Sushi, lobster, filet steak, scallops, shrimp, calamari, chicken..... well, you get the idea. What with the added rice and vegetables, it was a ""belly-busting-feast."" And again, because of the great company, we had a wonderful time.

So overall, I gave this restaurant 3-stars. It was the total experience. The food was good, and more important, the company was great. But as you can see from my comments, I felt like this particular Benihanas location was struggling to meet the corporate concept; trying to do it with Pittsburgh locals who, from the hosts to the bartending staff, to the chef and server staff, just seemed like misfits.

All but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00, but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated, as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated.  Fortunately, the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm.  It was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made. Without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders.  She (name withheld because I don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks, but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders.  As I was waiting I looked over at the table next to us, who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday.  At one point the mother (I'm assuming) smiled at me and said, ""I hope you get out before midnight. We've been here over two hours.  We're taking our cake and getting out of here.""

Upon taking our orders, one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill, etc.).  Our server said that she would have to ask the manager, who came to our table shortly thereafter.  When the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table, not the restaurant, but I'm not certain of this. Following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side.  I asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table, but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables.  I understand his point, but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm.  Finally, he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option, but I'll leave it at that.  

Our chef Tom eventually arrived at our table. He was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation.  During his time at the table my Emperor's Salad was delivered, as were the majority of my table's sushi orders.  However, two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time.  In fact, they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals.  At one point, they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, who responded that they were ""waiting for the rice.""  When she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay.  

Two hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at Benihana, we left.  From start to finish, the entire evening was a terrible experience.  It was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom.  Were it not for the kindness and professionalism of Tom (and the awesome company of friends), the night would have been a complete waste.  

My final thought is this. The food was fine, but because I was feeling particularly piggish on this Tuesday evening, I enjoyed two California rolls from my stash of Costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant. The difference between Costco's rolls and Benihana's...a toss up - just sayin.

The food is okay. There are better hibachi options in the area. The service can be okay or awful. One time, we were there with our kids and had an absolutely EVIL waitress. One of my kids isn't a big eater, so instead of ordering her a full kids' meal, we just got a side order of rice and soup. The kids' meal her brother was having came with ice cream, so when we were done with dinner, we asked if she could get ice cream as well. I don't know if she thought we wanted the ice cream free (which we definitely didn't!) but she said no, we absolutely COULD NOT order ice cream separately.

My boyfriend and I tried them out on Labor Day, just get something different from what we normally do. He had been some years back before, and this was my first time. Getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain (I don't know, is that considered a mountain, or is it a hill? Being from the south everything that makes me lift my legs/feet higher is a mountain). It was rather empty as it was only like 11.30AM, but that was ok with us as we're not a big fan of people (joke ... maybe). The interior is ridiculously awesome, especially the raised bar.

Our chef walks up and it's a white man, which was a definite first for me at a Japanese steakhouse. And he seemed out of it. During the course of the meal, he did inform us that he was hungover ... it's Labor Day, what're gonna do? It didn't bother me too much, but I think he did annoy the hell out of my boyfriend lol. He told some good albeit corny jokes, did the usual tricks plus a few new ones - he was overall entertaining.

The food: oh man, was it yummy. I got the soba noodles and beef julienne. The noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that I couldn't describe, but they were the best soba noodles I have ever had. The beef julienne was also super delicious. The sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce, but it didn't taste like it at all to me, which was fine with me because I'm not a big teriyaki fan. 

After eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece. The bartender was really cool and the bar area had a great vibe and atmosphere. Sure, Japanese Steakhouses are pricey, but this is one of the few I've been to that is more than worth it.",1,1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA,0,5,2012-09-11,review,1

We love hibachi restaurants and go to various area restaurants on a regular basis.  Benihana is the oldest of the hibachi restaurants in the area, so we had not been for a while.  We arrived early before the rest of our party and the staff was very welcoming.  They would regularly stop by and make sure we didnt need anything.  After our party arrived, we were seated and our chef came out. He was very entertaining and the food tasted amazing.  The best part was how accommodating the staff was.  One member of our party had a food allergy and the manager specifically came over to ensure that all food would be made in the back and would not come in contact with other ingredients.

We had our 2 year old daughter with us and part way through the meal she started squirming and wanted to walk around the restaurant.  After a few ""laps"" of the restaurant, without us asking, the manager came out with crayons and paper which made our daughter VERY happy.  

Everyone was so pleasant and the food was better than I had remembered.  Benihana has a lot of competition from Saga, Nakama and others, but after our most recent visit, Benihana definitely has the best value and the best staff.

Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char, which none of our food had. I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces, he acted confused when I asked for them. Additionally, we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner, we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand.

You go to Hibachi for a show, but it's not fun when the cook makes the SAME Giant Eagle joke the entire time.  He also couldn't perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from Hibachi chefs.  The food. Not good.  My boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle.  He didn't bother to have the guy heat it more, b/c it would have just been a hassle.  The chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server.  Then after everything was cooked, he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp. I replied ""no, you never served me any."" (I had ordered the chicken and shrimp.)  He then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more.

We've always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated, even when we've had reservations. In the past its been forgivable, mostly because its close to home for us, the food is okay (albeit a little pricey), and my Grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi. But that all changed last night when we went out with a party of 8 for my and my mothers birthday. 

I made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner. When I called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening. Our reservations were for 7:30. 

We arrive a little early at 7:20 and I let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in. Then we basically just wait and wait and wait. We notice the hostess turning people away, and we notice two tables who have been seated for about 30 minutes now haven't even gotten their soups or salads. By now its nearly 8 O'clock. Then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long. By this point we've been waiting for 45 minutes. My sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only 1 hibachi chef working, but there are SEVEN tables seated, all waiting for food/drinks. So I ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated. She informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table, because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick. It would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders. 

This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. First of all, the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait. OR, the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule. Either way, we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour, not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat, on an evening when we had reservations. 

We decided to call Ichiban to see if they could accommodate us. They told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately. As we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food! It was now about 8:20pm. 

Our first dinner at Ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at Benihana, so I don't think we'll ever be going back there. I think Ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice.",0,1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA,0,1,2014-12-30,review,0

I know, you're probably thinking ""What DOES this girl like about Mad Mex?""

The tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts.  The California grilled salad.  The chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos.  Nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent.  Their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas).  Basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine.

They have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers.

I usually go to the Robinson location as it's near my office.  It's a lot more spacious than the Oakland location, which can feel a bit claustrophobic to me on a busy night.  (Though late nights there are fun with half-off food specials after 11...)

I like getting the chips with different dips.  The Yucatan Bean Dip is to die for, and the Dos Equis queso dip and fire-roasted tomato chipotle salsa are also great.  For entrees I usually go with the fish tacos or one of the quesadillas.

They have great lunch specials too.  I can get a huge quesadilla and a salad with their delicious lime-cilantro dressing for like $7!  Good Happy Hour specials, too, on margaritas and drafts.

Mad Mex offers a funky decor and typically quick service.  If you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, I suggest reservations because there's nowhere really to relax indoors when you are waiting for a table.

Being regulars, we have settled into a few choice menu items.  If you bother to read the menu, you'll notice a few jokes hidden in the description of items, so even if you are a regular, it's worth a read.  We always start with some chips and pico or the Picka Dippa and some margaritas.  The black bean dip is to die for.  Slight bit of spice, creamy black beans and a little bit of melted cheese.  The beer cheese isn't my favorite, so that one is never ordered, but we regularly switch up the salsa choices.  For margaritas, we have settled on the Ultimate margarita or the Don Julio VIP.

The burritos are huge.  Seriously, as big as your face type of huge.  At this restaurant, you will definitely use your silverware.  Of course, they are filled with a lot of rice and beans, so I recommend to pay extra for double meat to make a more desirable meat to starch ratio.  The chimichanga is great, but pre-made so they can't accomodate any changes.  The tacos and fajitas are good and come with nice warm flour tortillas.  Enchiladas tend to be oversauced, but overall good.  

The food tends to be quite consistant and you get what you expect, but other parts of the meal tend to be hit or miss:
1. I think it's the sour mix, but something about the margaritas tends to be really inconsistant.  Sometimes you get a strong one, sometimes not so strong.... Sometimes you get a sweet one, sometimes you get a sour one.  It's never terrible by any means, but you really never know what you are going to get.  The Greentree location has the most variation in the margaritas while McNight road's margaritas tend to be better more often.
2. As off-season tomatoes tend to be finiky, sometimes the pico is fresh and flavorful, sometimes you get the gritty or cardboard-ish tomatoes.
3. Some of there servers are great while other times you get one that leaves you wanting more from the service.

In contrast to another review, YES, they do appreciate you on your birthday.  None of that childish singing or a flamboyant dessert... if you are on there list, you get a birthday card for a free burrito.  That's better than any of that cheesy crap.  Although a casual dining chain restaurant typically isn't worthy birthday dinner fare, if someone's giving away a free burrito, I am there.",0,hhNlQWaKqGbMPoeZHoL-IQ,0,4,2012-12-29,review,0

Typically I order a side of the Southwestern sauce because like I said I LOVE the stuff and it's nice to dip the wrap or fries in it for an extra kick.  Typically when I've order one of my Southwestern sauce smothered wraps/burritos at Robinson and McKnight they douse enough of the sauce on the wrap that I only need to use the sauce on the side for my fries.  The Greentree wrap was so dry and had itty bitty drops of the sauce in the wrap so I'm glad I asked for a side of the sauce.

Also the waffle fries which typically come out hot, fresh and delish, were all welded together that I had to peel each one off the other.

The atmosphere is very fun too, the art is pretty cool  and resembles the Mexican Day of the Dead, and it just has a relaxed vibe to it. It is a casual place so you are perfect in jeans!

Their margaritas are really good and reasonably priced. Are you a beer drinker? They have a ton of beers that they serve and a decent amount on tap. Around fall they have an awesome selection of fall beers and they have pumpkin beer.

Also in fall they have this wonderful little thing called a gobblerito.  You must try it,  it is the most amazing thing I have ever tried.  Although to some the idea may sound gross, you MUST give it a try!!! A gobblerito is: turkey, stuffing,  corn, some black beans, and mashed potatoes all wrapped up neatly in a burrito shell.

I think this once again has to do with little me's disliking of Mexican-type foods and eateries. Fortunately, adult me has much better taste than little me, which means I get to enjoy Mad Mex in all of its glory now.

I've been at this location a couple times the last couple of months and it hasn't let me down yet. The first time I wanted to get in on the Gobblerito trend that half of my coworkers were enjoying during November, so I ordered that and a frozen margarita. Both were pretty darn awesome - I took half of my massive Thanksgiving burrito home and proceeded to eat nothing but that and more Thanksgiving food for the next few days. Most notable from that first visit was the fact that even though the place was hopping, the service was super quick. In fact my waitress came and asked about my drink order before I'd even opened the drink menu - it was just that quick. The kitchen had my meal ready super quickly as well and I was out the door in under a hour. Pretty darn impressive considering just how busy they were that night.

Since then Mad Mex hasn't disappointed. The service hasn't been AS prompt since then but it's certainly been reasonable, and the speed in the kitchen makes up for any order delays. I practically devoured my shrimp, spinach and mushroom quesadilla during my last visit - talk about a meal with lots of my favorite ingredients! Ingredients, I must add, which were all well cooked and seasoned and mixed together in the right varieties, resulting in a well-balanced and flavorful meal. I also remain absolutely in LOVE with their variety of margaritas, which are impressively strong and delicious no matter what size drink you order.

Really, my only complaint is their need to play loud background noise to ""set the mood"" for the place - I'd never want to bring a large group here because of the soundtrack they've got going.

It was really nice because I had already started looking for something else, so great on the sales end on their part.

There were 18 people in our class and we were in the demonstration kitchen. We learned how to roll three different types of sushi, and all of the steps that go along with it.

Then there's dinner. Their burgers are kind of fantastic. I'm still not over the whole eating a rare cooked burger so everywhere in PA gets added bonus points for that. So overall it's a good burger, but it's certainly not the best burger I've ever eaten and there's nothing really creative about their burgers to make them stand apart from other place's burgers. 

The atmosphere is something between a TGIFridays or Chili's but very Pittsburgh-centric. I found it somewhere between comforting and annoying. I don't really like chain restaurants but this one had some nice personal stuff to keep it from venturing into the Fridays realm.

Also, if you're a craft beer & burger sort a gal, you'll notice this place is not for you. There's more than Bud, but not a lot.

We ordered the wedge salad, an appetizer trio, and the wings (which I ordered extra crispy).  The salad came first and was pretty good but seemed to not have any toppings except for the salad dressing.  The appetizer trio came out next and was a bit of a disappointment.  The potato skins weren't that good- mushy and no seasoning (salt/spice).  Also, the bacon was soft and mushy.  The nachos were edible but nothing to write home about- again a little mushy once you got below the ones on the top and the guacamole was pretty bland.  The buffalo chicken planks were a little under-cooked for my taste but were otherwise good.  The buffalo wings came out last and I was happy with them- they were done (crispy) the way I like them.  The wings were what I was craving when I walked into the place- the void was filled.  

The service was a little slow.  We sat at the bar and there were only 2 other people at the bar and only 1 table with 4 people elsewhere in the place.  They seemed to be starting to close up at that time.  It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks because the bartender dropped a wine bottle- so we had to wait for him to clean it up and hear his amazing account of the accident before being served.    

I would go back again the next time I crave wings (because decent wings are really hard to find in the South Hills).  Maybe during the day the service will be faster.  I will definitely order the wedge salad again and the wings but will be more careful when ordering the appetizer.",0,SgQYRICpMdWCmY7wM2Cmcw,1,3,2014-04-17,review,0

It's hard to go wrong with Panera. You can eat pretty healthy here if you try. Not everything is healthy, but there definitely are options. I also like that they use fresh ingredients and antibiotic free chicken. 

In my opinion, you can't go wrong with their soups, they are my favorite. Some are better for you than others like the vegetable pesto and black bean soups however, if you get a ""you pick two meal"", you can splurge on the less healthy ones like creamy wild rice and chicken. What is a you pick two you ask? It is a meal you create by picking two items from soups, salads, sandwiches, paninis, and pastas. You get a half of each selection that you pick, which is nice to try some of their different menu items.

I walked in to an empty restaurant and was worried, but the owner Frank was there to greet me and how pleasant he was. He saw the concern on my face and brought me over to family pictures showing how long the restaurant has been in business and has been a success.
So, not knowing what to order, because so many things looked yummy, he suggested the Pork Chop Florentine, OMG!!! DELICIOUS!!!
AND he prepared it himself!
I definitely, highly, recommend dining here when in the Pittsburgh/Greentree area.

Overwhelmed with work at that time of the night and unfamiliarity with the area prompted a quick call for their Ad's Rockin' Pasta ($17). I was initially told the delivery would arrive in 45 minutes to an hour, but the food came knocking on my hotel room sooner than expected. 

The complimentary mini garlic buns were cooled by that time. It was over-buttered but yummy nonetheless. It was a delight to see the whopping serving of pasta after not having anything to eat all day. Thankfully it was kept warm by the plastic container and comforting with every bite. The generous servings of angel hair was filled to the brim with juicy chicken slices, very few shrimps, mushrooms, roasted and hot peppers drenched in a mild marinara sauce. The flood of sweet and semi-savory marinara was not the ideal and the peppers also did not make an impression. The quality of the pasta was overcooked and oversoaked, but the pieces of chunky chicken were tender and delicious. The side salad did not look very fresh and was not newsworthy.

I didn't get a chance to visit the venue to get a better impression of the establishment, but as a delivery service I thought it was fast while portions were very generous. Value wise, kudos to them for having a $5 children's menu for those at the ages 2-10. For my dish however, I still consider it overpriced for what was supposed to be their fanciest pasta dish. 2.5 stars for the experience.",12,KZXtzoI84iI1CEcAnD7OPA,9,3,2009-12-05,review,12

Our waiter was friendly and prompt. We both ordered the pasta primavera with chicken. The portions are huge-- I have enough leftover for two more meals. The sauce was creamy and flavorful, and there were enough veggies. The side salad was a bit lacking-- it's just iceberg lettuce (my mom says there seemed to be romaine too) with some olives and a couple grape tomatoes. They give you these awesome little garlic knots with the salad and entree. The dessert was the highlight. I ordered the homemade cannoli. It was a good size, plenty to share between two people. Delicious crispy shell, amazing ricotta filling with chocolate chips, covered in powered sugar. It was just as good as the cannoli I'd had from an award-winning bakery in New York City!

Speaking of which, if someone would like to organize some sort of tournament to decide the the dominant donut producers in the Three Rivers area, I would gladly volunteer my expertise as a judge and set aside my love for Better-Maid in order to conduct myself with the impartiality and professional one would expect from a regional donut judge.

The donuts themselves are the more traditional style cake donuts, with a moist and crumbly inside, slight crunchy outside. They are amazing and need to be experienced.

The only knock on this place is that if you don't get there early, they tend to sell out occaisonally. Also, they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.

As mentioned by others, this road is not in the best shape. It seems like every couple of miles there's construction. Not anyone working on site...but hey, you still have to slow down. Another issue...most of the roadway is 55 mph. This drives me insane...because in certain spots it's 55, and in others it's 65. Luckily I haven't had any speeding tickets here...but my warning, be aware of your speed.

The toll booth operators are ok, for the most part. You will get those with the evil attitudes. Like, I'm sorry I disturbed you...but lady you're the only one open. I'll make sure to sign up for EZ Pass so I can bypass you.

And lastly...the price. So back when I was in college I frequented this road, from Pittsburgh to Philly and back. I believe the amount one way was between $12-15. Now...one way? Goodness I don't know the price...but let's put this in perspective. I now only drive the Pittsburgh/Breezewood route...and it's  $12.60 one way. And this isn't even the halfway point to Philly. 

In theory you can bypass the turnpike by driving I-80 but this road is impassable if it's snowing. And there aren't as many rest stops. So PA knows you have no choice...and will charge you whatever on the turnpike. 

FYI - prices are scheduled to go up Jan 1 2015. The toll booth operators are clueless as to how much the increase will be. One toll booth operator was snippy with me when I asked her. Oh well.",0,7Q2eP_xd--kZQkSpId_N6Q,0,2,2014-12-28,review,0

Back then it had Chi-Chi's (where thankfully I never ate. A hepatitis scare did them in), David Weis, Pharmor, CompUsa, Syms, etc were all here. 

Now the mall is mainly deserted. Only one floor is still open, and even that's got a vacancy rate of about 50%! Surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business. Kmart is doing okay as is the Giant Eagle. Phantom of the Attic is alive and well and so is Pittsburgh Sports Deli. That's not an eatery either. It's a sports memorabilia store.

Although our room was down a very narrow corridor and a joining room to another room, it was clean and updated with a nice flat screen TV. We had Bath n Body Works products, which I use at home. The best part of the hotel was the free shuttle to and from the concert. I hate having to drive in traffic and parking would have cost us a pretty penny. The staff are wonderful!

There is also a pool which we missed because we weren't at the hotel long enough. We did get to take advantage of the free wii fi which was very nice. The purpose of our stay was a place to sleep and for this purpose, this hotel served us well. However, if you intend on staying an extended amount of the time at the hotel, I would suggest elsewhere. The quaint room made me feel very claustrophobic. As well, there aren't any places to eat near. I would stay there again for a reason of a place to crash after a concert or something similar.

My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.

Sorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.

Okay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant.

The facility is very clean and the staff is very helpful. You can tell they recently renovated. Their workout facility was great, which is a nice change of pace from the majority of the hotels I have stayed in. The rooms are very spacious and have a refrigerator and microwave. This is great if you don't feel like going out to eat. There is a Giant Eagle right down the street too.

The hotel offers free wifi which has great speed and makes working from your room easy. There is a shuttle service that runs from the hotel to down town ever hour. All you have to do is ask the front desk and they will help you coordinate. They offer a free breakfast in the morning which is always great as well.

We needed to find a place not too far from Heinz Stadium for a reasonable price. We paid about $90 per night for this place, and the experience started poorly. We walked in and the two lobby TVs were tuned to Judge Judy (for the front desk employee's viewing pleasure). Employees watching reality TV during business hours really puts me off. It was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order.  Two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings. It was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions. To the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order. My wife pointed out her extreme cleavage, but I did not want to get lost there. We had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room. She tended to mumble, but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions. We finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the 4th floor. In a way I felt as if we were at some sort of slum. I kept looking for gang tagging. The room was adequate (and I believe this was a renovated room), but a Motel 6 would be an upgrade. Whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible. The swimming pool was a swamp (I am not kidding), but I am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time. The next morning we went down to the front desk again. This time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that I was interrupting her call.  She did not even hang up; she just put the phone to her side, answered my question, and then continued her conversation. 

Personally, I think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and Hollywood should contact this place. It needs to be knocked down, or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality. If construction is on track (and I suspect something is wrong), get staff that really is gracious to customers. There are people that need jobs out there and I assure you with proper management they will do a great job. Don't stay here for over $45 per night (the price is due to the breakfast offered). Personally I would not stay here until they fix the place, but for some reason I don't feel that it will ever happen. Something just feels wrong.

I'd like to start by saying that I'm not much of a complainer, but if could have given 0 stars, I would have. 

So we are on our way up to room when we passed a vending machine with water underneath it. I assumed it was leaking and brushed it off. I don't care that much about little things like that especially since we were just sleeping there. After a great hockey game and a bar crawl, we came back to the hotel and got ready for bed. There was absolutely no hot water for my shower. So cold I wouldn't even consider hopping in really quick. It was late so I let it go and decided to try again in the morning. When I woke up it was the same thing. At this point I was fuming. I NEED a shower man!

So I put on my angry pants and headed down the hall towards the elevator. Right in front of the elevator door there is a water fall pouring out of the ceiling from the third floor.

4258,dfL6_V36C5frDuoGCxr6Ew,xCR7D6_k1-UTOvyssmWfmw,"Ah, yes, what has yet to be said about this Clarion in Greentree, which is commonly known as the hotel of perpetual construction? Check the reviews folks (I sure wish I had) and you'll see that this place has been under construction for at least four years!
My family, and I'm sure countless others, initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby Doubletree Hotel. But even with directions, we drove right past the Clarion because: 1). There are no hotel signs; 2). We were arriving at night and the building was completely dark; 3). There were no parked cars visible from the road; and 4). The entire front of the building was boarded up.
When we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone, which once represented the entrance to the hotel, we saw a tiny sign directing us to the ""Temporary Lobby"" in the back of the hotel. The makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk. The clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer, but found it as soon I had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation email.
We were given a room on the second floor, thus we walked past stairwells that were closed (because of endlessly drying 'wet paint') and an out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine, until we located the elevator. Well, let me tell you folks, Disney's Tower of Terror ride is less frightening than this elevator. It looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees. The floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it, leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floor.
When we got to our room, the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on. We did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets, but thankfully no bugs. We also checked for the free Wi-Fi signal and found that it was completely useless (maybe that's why the desk clerk couldn't locate our reservation).
Finding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt, where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways. The adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building (thankfully it wasn't raining like it had been all night). I then realized that I had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining area.
There was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about Complementary Breakfast and the strange phrase ""Gratuity Included."" But inside the dining room there were at least two clearly-marked 'Tip Jars.' Now, I've been at some pretty trashy hotels in my travels, but I've never seen a tip jar in the dining room. I've also never been in a hotel dining room where it looked like a bomb had gone off, but there were drop cloths, power tools and all sorts of debris everywhere.
When I got in line for the grub, I learned how the attendant earned her tips: she was there to help patrons identify the food. The person in front of me inquired about the gray-looking sausage-like links and was dutifully informed that they represented turkey sausage, adding, ""Because Clarion cares about your health."" I'm not kidding (who could make something like that up?). Anyway, I tried this so-called health food, because the only other hot alternative was French Toast and I did not want any syrupy food that morning. Guess what? The sausage had some kind of sugary additive to make the links taste like syrup! Real healthy, right? Thus, I ended up just getting a cup of coffee and returning to my room to pack up. The coffee was okay, by the way.
In conclusion, I would not have stayed at the Greentree Clarion had I not made prior reservations and had not been coming back after midnight following a music festival where it rained all day. Plus, we used our loyalty points for this room, so I couldn't even request a discount.
Believe me, HUD would shut this place down if it was an apartment building and the Dept. of Homeland Security would never even consider housing immigrants there.

Listen when I tell you, go to their website and request, demand, beg, do anything you can to get them to open one here in Pittsburgh! Seriously, the whole wheat Long Island bagels are pretty damn fine. Boiled, then baked a little darker than most bagels, then doused with garlic and onion, poppy and sesame seeds. Incredibly delicious! They're California Granola bagels are whole grain and hearty. The Italian bagels are like a mini loaf of Italian bread, covered in oregano, basil, rosemary, and garlic, they put olive oil in the raw dough, bellisimo! 

Okay, 359 miles southwest we have Pittsburgh with no visible sign of a decent bagel place, well that's not entirely true, Einstein Brothers has a good bagel, not a great bagel. Where Ithaca Bakery has 9 different vegetarian sandwiches, good luck trying to find anything like that here. 

When I did enjoy meats, my choice here was the Nova Lox with a shmear, tomato, onion on a whole wheat bagel. Not exactly a low cal meal, later I found out it had a whopping 700 calories and over 20 grams of fat. Even with the lite cream cheese this had 600 calories and 12 grams of fat. Now I have a whole grain bagel with hummus. 

I will say their pretzel bagels are rather good, nice crust and crunch from salt, a chewy center and makes an awesome pizza bagel.

Their bagels are pretty expensive, a baker's dozen and a container of cream cheese is over 14 bucks. In a town with a pizza joint on every corner, and an Italian restaurant in every community, you'd think someone would open an authentic bagel place with unique flavors and varieties.",2,xSYGuHecEWP7At0HYbO5Jg,1,3,2012-03-01,review,3

It gets SLAMMED around 6:30 or 7 with the before work crowd.  I can still remember people's faces and what they ordered.  I could never understand the woman who ordered a Venti (large) 8 pump white chocolate mocha with whip EVERY morning.  I guess girl needed her sugar to survive in the AM.  

The nice thing is they're ALWAYS open.  Much to the chagrin of me and my coworkers with the madness of LIght Up NIght and St. Patrick's day drunken festivities.  But it's nice for the tourists to stop in and grab a quick drink and some advice on where to go downtown on a Saturday morning.

If you decide to go here, take my advice and take your own nail polish.  As for me, I picked out an OPI nail polish and they poured acetone in the nail polish to make it thinner!! I hate it when they do this, I guess its just their way of being cheap and not taking out a new nail polish.  The end result is that there are bubbles now on my nails and less than 24 hours later I just noticed that one of my nails has already chipped.  To make matters worse, their hot water was not working properly so they gave me my manicure and pedicure with pure COLD water.

- the studio space itself is great.  Lots of windows which let lots of light in.
- the bathrooms are very clean and really nice.

She's great, and I wasn't about to give up on her just because she moved to a nicer salon that happens to be substantially cheaper than the old place.  For a review of Lacy, please see my review of L'Azur Salon.

The salon itself is really nice - they have a fantastic view, and lots of nice touches.  You can have coffee or tea (and cookies), and they have a nice locker system so you don't have to lug your purse to and from the styling stations.  Everything seems really clean and open, and the clientele seem younger and hipper than some of the other salons I've been to.

Add the bulldog that roams around, and you've got a super great experience.  They only do hair, and a tip for the new - take the elevator to get into the salon.  I like walking, and took the stairs, which actually does not lead into the salon.  They use Bumble and bumble products, but are not super pushy about it.  The receptionist could use a little bit of an attitude adjustment - I swear she sighed and rolled her eyes at me when I said I didn't want my receipt.",0,ih6d7hBWss05xXWUznuFaw,1,5,2010-04-29,review,2

The space is the best thing about it- large, new and beautiful decor.  They have good products too like Bumble and Bumble but they also push the Kerastase on you, which I don't like. For the value, the prices are very high with mixed results.  Ask about how much experience people have because there are some people with little experience (less than one year). I think Nicolette is the best- has good experience and she did a great job.  Tried the owner Jim and hair came out brassy orange instead of blonde.  When came back to have it fixed, he handled it poorly with me. There is something to be desired for the customer service overall- have definetely had sub-par treatment at front desk and others.",0,ih6d7hBWss05xXWUznuFaw,0,3,2010-05-19,review,0
4301,OOIU9ekqAdmSFqHnKFT8EQ,Og1-7Plrm0du4FVFrjGvKw,"I just moved to Pittsburgh and used Yelp to pick MCN Salon. The reviews nailed it. This place is great! Why? Let me count the reasons:

My stylist is Kara and woo-ee is she fab. Not only did she give me a great cut (I had wayyyy long hair and wanted to get something lighter, without losing too much length--I'm getting married in months) but she is wicked bubbly and fun and great to chat with. At my first visit we talked about my hair, what issues I have, and she promised to research various solutions to provide me with awesome hair. She's very open about trying different things (e.g., perhaps a multivitamin--work from the inside out--to fix hair, rather than slathering on lots of product) and really seems to care about getting it right. Go to Kara!

The rest of the staff are equally friendly and fun. The salon definitely has a hip, young vibe, without making my (somewhat) unhip self feel awkward. Great open space, very clean, no chemical stinks, lockers for your purse, coffee/tea/water, tons of magazines, and a phenomenal view of East Liberty. Just a chill place. Add a friendly bulldog and it can't be beat.

All in all, I have to thank Yelp for absolutely pointing me in the right direction! If you're looking for a great salon with reasonable prices and friendly folks, MCN will be a perfect fit!

PS. Definitely take the elevator--you actually have to. Stairs only go to the 2nd floor, and MCN is on the 3rd.",1,ih6d7hBWss05xXWUznuFaw,0,5,2010-08-18,review,4

I came across MCN through Yelp and decided to give them a try b/c of their fantastic reviews.  I will attest that the hype is true!  You may wonder why then did I only give them 4 stars...well let me reiterate that I'm super critical of hair salons and I'll explain later the reason for the missing star.  Overall, this place is great because they really know what they're doing.  I explained what I was looking for and Heather did exactly what I wanted and was also helpful in suggesting a few tips to acheive the results I was looking for.  

I like to keep my hair longer yet still have layers and it was like Heather could envision what I was seeing!  The atmosphere is trendy, the talent is top-notch, and the experience is delightful.  

I only gave the place 4 stars b/c at the end when they were styling my hair, I felt like they didn't really know how to style curly hair.  My hair was half dry and they were trying to slather on some gel, which is completely not helpful as most curly hair girls know.

Great service from the stylists but if your receptionist won't try and get your customer in then there are other salons.  That's too bad because I really liked the place when I went.  Fortunately, Yelpers have other suggestions for salons in this city.

Once again, the Yelpers come through!  Just moved to Pittsburgh 6 weeks ago and was in desperate need of a haircolor and cut.  Serached on Yelp and voila!  MCN.  I am beyond thrilled.

I have never cried after a haircut (except for a horrible one) but I had such happy tears after this one!  First of all, the receptionist didn't ""scold"" me like so many other places do because I was 10 minutes late.  Then I was offered a drink (I had brought my own iced tea) and they provided me with ice and a glass.  Following Yelpers advice I had my color done by Heather and my cut by Kara.  

To say the least I cannot remember the last time I looked so stinkin' cute!  They were nice, extremely professional, and just amazing.  Their techniques were of really listening to their client (which is something new and different from my other hair stylists/colorists!)  Heather mixed a color that looks perfect for my skin color and provided me with a magazine while I was waiting so I could pick out which cuts I liked.  Kara then came over while my color was working and looked at the pics I had picked.  She talked with me again before starting the cut and then she did her what I can only call MAGIC!

I bought some products that were used and never felt a ""hard sell"" whatsoever.

Thank you YELPERS!  Heather and Kara are AMAZING and MCN is now my salon of choice (I already booked my next appointments!).  I highly recommend these two and this salon.

However, since it closed down, I hadn't been able to get a decent haircut in Pittsburgh (I've had to wait to go back to California to cut my hair).  I've actually tried this salon prior to getting Kara and I left very unhappy (my hair looked like it hadn't been cut at all and I had to pay $50+ for it).  However, I decided to give MCN another try and get an appointment with Kara based on other Yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed.

It is a response to a strict no-returns policy on salon products, which makes me pretty mad: I couldn't have known they recommended the wrong product without trying it, and now that I tried it, they won't refund my purchase.  Catch-22.  I came in to buy a replacement for my normal bumble and bumble curl creme for thick hair, and was told by the receptionist that bumble and bumble's ""defining creme for fine curls"" is the new packaging of that product (which seemed weird to begin with...thick hair..fine curls...) Nope, it's totally different and it doesn't work for me.  I used it twice, figured that out, and now I'm stuck with an expensive product I can't use. I called bumble and bumble and they told me that the product I use has been discontinued.  All my previous salons in other cities would have honored a return in this situation.

I ended up getting probably the worst haircut I'd had in 10 years. It ended up a good 4 inches shorter than I discussed with the stylist. In addition, she took the fact that I work in a professional office to mean that I wanted an ugly, boring, mom-ish haircut. It's taken almost a year to grow back to the length it was before. I admittedly should have complained then and there, but I'm a wuss. 

Additionally, the experience at the salon left much to be desired. I went in the late morning on a weekday. There was a little girl there (around 3 or 4) with her nanny. Apparently her mom was a regular customer. The little girl was getting a haircut and she cried and screamed for 25 minutes. I know kids will be kids, and I don't blame the little girl for being scared or cranky. I do blame the salon for not finding a way for the girl not to disrupt the entire salon - taking her to a back room, taking her outside to calm down, not allowing children in an adult, supposedly high-end salon, etc. Something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache.

I'm an oxymoron I work in cosmetics, do professional makeup and skincare, have access to all the wonderful anti aging lasers, injectibles, botox, fat melting machines, but then I hate wearing makeup, getting procedures done, and let my hair grow out without a visit to the salon that is long overdo. I'm still that little tomboy climbing trees, I guess. Low maintenance by weekday, then I bust out the fabulous by night. 

The point being that I had let my hair go for quite awhile and the groupon just came out yesterday after I had made my much needed appointment! Already scheduled, groupon the day before my appointment, and I got a great haircut! Triple score! Plus they have pets hanging out! Quadruple SCORE! Places where you can bring a pet to work are super cool, I like the laid back implication for the business. 

Heather was my stylist and we hit it off amazingly, I gave her advice about skin treatments that would be right for her and she explained what kind of cut would be best for me. I asked about extensions because I have been curious to try them but she said the clip on ones would be better for my hair type. I appreciate that she gave me the truth straight up. I don't want my hair getting damaged after the things I have done to it! She gave me a modern chick look that I love, I can have a soft wavy romantic look, or I can straighten it and pull out the chunkiness for an edgier look. Thanks Heather, it's so easy and manageable.

Sara did a great job and continues to do so (I'm loyal like that). She consults me first and doesn't deviate from what we agree upon. Her demeanor is professional and friendly. While I was waiting for my color to process, MCN has some outlets for you to plug in your computer to pass the time.

Reasonably priced and another nice thing is that MCN occasionally will give free goodies as a thank you or for the holidays. While certainly the do is most important, the little things count as well. I will say though that they do seem a little pushy with product and the product may not even be the best one for your hair.

So my earlier review focused on Kara's fabulous cuts, awesome personality, and the cool vibe going on at MCN.

Wel...I fell prey to my addiction and have been coloring my hair again. Since Kara's been awesome all along, I'm sticking with her. So far I've had her color my hair about 5 times, and she is as fantastic as I could wish! My big issue with coloring is that I'm super horrible about getting my color done, thus I end up with horrific roots. Kara and I discussed my irregular coloring, and she came up with some highlights and lowlights that blend together really nicely and give me plenty of time (i.e., 10 weeks!) between colorings without looking bad. 

I'm pretty flexible when it comes to hair colors (try it, why not? it always grows back!), so we've done a bunch of different things: highlights, lowlights, single-process, highlights with pull-through...and every time it looks excellent!

But after my last haircut, I'm going to suck it up, and make the 45 minute drive back to my old stylist in Peters Township.
Basically - I just feel like they're trying to up-sell you the entire time on products and more services.  For example, if I wanted my eyebrows colored, I probably would have added that to my appointment.
Their stylists are GREAT, don't get me wrong, but I just don't feel like I'm being pampered or focused on when I'm there.  The last time, my stylist was working on 3 different people while I was getting a cut and color.  Therefore, that left junior stylists to wash and dry my hair.  The time before that, the stylist was working on 2 different people.  I have no problem with that - I just don't know who to tip at the end because I feel like my main stylist, actually did very little in the long run.  
Plus - I told my stylist on our very first visit - ""I don't want to think about my hair.  YOU are the STYLIST!  YOU are the DESIGNER!  Every time I come in here, I will want a different hair cut, but I want YOU to do it.  You will NEVER hear me say, 'just trim it up and do like we did last time'.  So please, I trust you to just make me look HOT.""
Well - the whole past year that I have gone there, I have sadly just been given the same haircut all 4 times.  I HATE THAT!  I'm not a hair stylist.  I know most people are stuck in their old ways and never like to change their hair; however, I am not.  I LOVE getting new hair cuts.  I love going from long to short...or from short to growing it out.  I like change - especially with the seasons!  Give me some edge!  Make me look sexy!   (I never feel this way leaving this salon).
Plus, every time I have gone for a cut and color, I feel like it has gotten more expensive every single time.  I don't know what I'm being charged for...but my first session was a little under $120.  This past time it was up to $175 and like I said, I only go for a cut and color.  So I don't understand why my appointment is $55 more than it was 6 weeks before (and 6 weeks before I actually bought PRODUCT!).

The salon itself is very stylish and hip, but it's welcoming enough that my husband feels comfortable going there himself.  I love it because they offer you tea while you wait.  They also have an adorable bulldog that permanently chill hanging out around the place.  The salon is on the second floor and has nice views out the huge windows.

None of that would matter if the service wasn't spectacular.  I can only review Ashley for hair and Leslee for make up.  Ashley has also listened to my rambling concerns about my hair, and has somehow understood them when I'm certain that I don't totally understand them myself.  When I'm getting antsy and just want something different, she knows when to take control and do something new.  She is extremely friendly and easy to talk to...or not talk if you aren't feeling up to it one day.  She builds a relationship with her clients and gets to know them so that she can offer suggestions that are actually useful.  I can't recommend her enough, for cuts, color, and for special event hair (she did my hair for my wedding and did a fabulous job).

Leslee did my makeup for my wedding and also did a great job.  We had a consultation before the big day and she was adamant that we work on it until I got exactly what I wanted.  She is a master at making eyes look striking.  Everyone loved the way my makeup looked.  She's also very friendly and will try anything you want!

I did not give MCN Salon 5 stars for three reasons.  1.  It's expensive.  It's not a lot more expensive than other well known salons in Pittsburgh, but it's the most expensive salon I've been too.  To be honest, if I hadn't followed Ashley to MCN I would probably not go there because of the prices.  I know she's worth it, though, so I'm willing to pay for great work.  2.  Several times people have tried to up sell me product or treatments during my haircut/color.  I would appreciate if they give me these choices before the haircolor/cut begins and not spring them on me mid-appt.  The last thing I want to do when I'm there is spend more money.  3.  One receptionist is not very pleasant to deal with.  She is often too busy to help you, doesn't listen to the stylists about scheduling appts, and is rude on the phone.  It's a shame that such a nice place is held back by front desk service issues.",1,ih6d7hBWss05xXWUznuFaw,0,4,2011-10-17,review,4

The staff is friendly, extremely accommodating, interactive, and they listened to what I wanted with my hair (to the tee)!  I've seen reviews that the stylists really push the sales of products and services.  Totally not true!  I felt no pressure to buy anything extra at all.  They educate their clients on how products work as well as the benefits and I walked out feeling much more educated and understanding how to achieve the style and health of my hair that i've always wanted. Love these guys!! 

Jim gave me the best cut and style that i've ever had. Loved him, his staff, the ambiance, and attention to detail.  I felt like he really cared about me and took the time to listen.  Totally worth every penny.

I tried to articulate that I wanted a hair cut that required minimal styling on my part. The hairdresser immediately shot me down, asking me how I expected to have my hair look nice if I wasn't willing to put work into it. She then berated me for not using styling products-- again, I'd rather sleep. 

Now, maybe a few people feel differently about their hair, but all I wanted was a cut that allowed for minimal styling on my part. I wasn't asking for some trendy 'do that needed 3 different products, a round brush, and a flat iron in order to re-create it. I ended up getting almost the same exact cut I had going in there (just an inch shorter). Oh, and she also told me the cut I had coming in wasn't entirely flattering because of it's blunt ends--- funny, I ended up with the same thing.

For highlights, a haircut, + tip it's about $200, so it's not cheap. The relatively high cost is the one bummer about MCN. But if you can spend $200 on color and highlights call MCN and book an appt with Lacie. You won't be disappointed!",0,ih6d7hBWss05xXWUznuFaw,0,4,2012-12-16,review,2

I was nervous about finding talent, especially since my last few hair appointments in a new city had been less than stellar experiences. I was worried I would never find another stylist on par with the super star I had in Miami.  I couldn't let worry prolong the inevitable, however, with grey starting to peek out and ends beginning to split,  so  I did what anyone would do by asking around, reading reviews online and praying.   Upon leaving MCN Salon with my hair cut and colored to perfection, I can tell you my prayers were answered.  After reading other positive reviews about Sarah here on Yelp, I decided to book with her.   Although, I have a long, classic hair, I watched her work on a variety of other clients while my color was processing.   Her vision and talent seemed limitless as I watched her style a young child to a very punk rock female and an older more traditional man. It was very cool to watch her use her talent to shape each individual's cut to their preferred style and preference, which is what we all hope for in the chair but don't always get.   And, she does all of this for a phenomenal price.    I had full color, hair cut and blow out for $130 and was blown away.  I don't remember the last time I left a salon with the complete package for less than $200.

I had been wanting to try MCN for quite some time, and I pass the salon almost every day so on a whim I finally just called and made a same day appointment for a womens cut.  I said I did not have a preference as to which ""level"" my stylist was, and they were able to fit me in with Margeaux.

If you can, book an appointment with her!  She should be Marg-WHOA--bc my hair looked FANTASTIC after we were done!  And trust me, my hair never looks fantastic.  

I was greeted warmly when I arrived and offered a beverage.  There was an adorable bull dog in the salon, and the dog ALSO  greeted me.  I loved it!  So cute and wrinkly...

Margeaux was warm and friendly and I felt comfortable talking to her about how i wanted my hair to look.  I believe I told her, ""I want my hair to look not like this,"" (pointing at my current hair).  My hair was limp and I'd dyed it black for the past 3 years.  I needed a change.  

I was kind of shocked when Margeaux told me she could get the black dye out of my hair bc stylists have told me that before, and it was a disaster every time.  There is a huge difference between what you get in a low end salon and a high end salon.  Margeaux explained the process to me, the science behind why it would work, brought me magazines, and spent the next hour or so foiling my hair.

Its always kind of awkward when you meet someone for time and have to have small talk---I really enjoyed having Margeaux work on my hair.  I just LIKED her, she was easy to talk to and it wasnt that awkward, ""What do you do?  Where do you live?"" conversation you typically have with a hairdresser for the first time.  We just had a normal conversation and as I  said before, I had a really good time.

All of the stylists there were extremely nice.  Kara came over and asked me how I was doing a few times, and several stylists stopped over to check on my transformation throughout the process.  Everyone was so nice I'd feel comfortable in any of their chairs.

My quick haircut ended up being a 4 hour appointment.  It takes a lot of time to get a lot of black dye out of your hair.

SHE SERIOUSLY GOT THE DYE OUT OF MY HAIR.  Seriously...whoa!

I have a new hair color, and she gave me a fantastic cut.  I cannot more highly recommend her.  I loved my hair and I have never left a salon loving my ahir before, I always leave thinking, ""It will look cute when it grows out a little bit and I style it myself.""

We are talking hair miracle.

I cut 5 inches off my hair and left without scissor shock.  Ok, maybe a little, I had a major transformation, but I love it.

I had mentioned I want hair i dont have to style every day and Margeaux said she could do that.  She wasn't kidding.  Even my freaking BED HEAD looks adorable.

BED HEAD.  yeah.  worth the price at any cost.

This is not the cheapest salon but if you need a major change like I did, it is worth it to spend the money.  My cut and extreme color work came to $240 but I dont think this is typical, you have to keep in mind I came in with jet black hair that had ot be stripped, toned, corrected, and now I've got medium auburn hair.  

So it probably costs a bit less if you're not having a complete hair color over haul.

I've recommended some of my friends to him who have had bad color jobs and he's been able to fix their disasters.

I tend to be someone who is open to letting my stylist do 'whatever they think works best' because let's face it, they are the expert. Even though I've been seeing him for years, he still always asks how I have been styling my hair and so forth to get me the right cut that works for me at that time. For example, in the summer, I love to let my hair air dry. He makes sure that during that season, the cut is going to work for how I'm planning to style my hair. His recommendations on products to achieve certain looks are spot on as well. I can replicate what he tells me to do at home and that's important to me.

-The space is very nice, spacious, with great natural light - very comfortable. 
-Staff is nice and polite. 
-Head massage was great.

-The way they push products is really over the top and annoying. I said I am not interested, but my stylist wouldn't stop. Moreover, apart from discussing how to cut my hair, all she discussed with me was how I really need to use this and that product. 
-She left me to go sell the product to someone else for good 10 minutes in the middle of cutting my hair. It gave me an impression that she cares more about selling products than anything else. 

I overall liked the salon, and I saw haircuts they gave to some friends of mine, and they do a good job.

When I got there, I was pleased with the look of the salon.  It's trendy, clean, and has a good vibe.  I met Ashley and she was pleasant enough, although she seems a bit young to be a senior stylist.  But who am I to know what the credentials are to be considered ""senior""?  She did a good job on the color and didn't do a terrible job on the cut, but I just wasn't wow'd.  She talked the entire time, which I don't typically mind and she's easy to talk to, but too much of the conversation was geared toward selling me product.  
My hair is straight and thin and I had previously gotten a stacked bob (which I hate and I'm trying to grow out).  She did her best to make it better, but it's still too stacked for my liking and is a bit uneven (found this out a week later when a different stylist was doing my hair for a wedding and fixed it).
The prices were a bit high for this area.  My haircut and highlight (she didn't do a full highlight, just partial which wasn't what I booked, but I didn't say anything so I'm somewhat to blame) came to $175.

Other than the tipping policy, it's a first-class salon.  I've been coming here for a couple several months now for color, cut, and styling.

I'm from out of town so I got lost going to my appt and called saying I would be 15 min late which they said was fine. When I got to my appt (scheduled for a blowout) Margo asked what style I wanted and I said volume and big curls. She said she couldn't do big curls because it would take too long and she only had 30 min. Because I had arrived late my service was cut short. I was FURIOUS. She went to go check if someone else could do it. So the receptionist came over and said that most clients arrive on time and that Margo could do what she could and I would have to do the rest at home. I went bananas On her because for being such a nice salon they certainly didn't have the customer service to go along with it. And isn't the customer always right?? There was absolutely no type of accommodation from Margo or the receptionist. My husband got his haircut there also ( and my sister in Law got a blowout, so 3 appts were booked) and the got the owner involved, Jim. He was so nice and very accommodating. And I truly appreciated his effort. I don't understand why Margo didn't call him initially? Because the receptionist wasn't management? He told Margo to finish my hair and he could do the rest and he used a curling iron for my entire head! Overall I appreciated Jim turning it around but Margo lacked customer service and the skinny blonde receptionist had an awful attitude.

To begin, I found out a few days ago that I will be interviewing for a new job tomorrow.  I immediately started calling around trying to book a last minute appointment.  I called Pageboy, and was told that they are all booked for the next few days.  No ""We can call you if someone cancels"" or anything remotely helpful.  Ok, whatever.  Then, I waited for Luxx to be open today, only to go down during business hours and find their boutique/salon closed.  Ugh.  Frustration set in.  So, I logged into Yelp and started reading salon reviews.  MCN has some great reviews.  I realized that I'd seen MCN while at Wholefoods,  and was always intrigued by the trendy-looking 3rd floor location.  I called and was immediately given two appointment options for today... so off I went.

Upon entering I was greeted by the receptionist who offered me a variety of beverages.   Right off the bat I began talking to a man, Jim, who I found out is the owner. He was so genuine, and we had a nice chitchat.  Then, off to get my hair done by Margeaux.  Super friendly girl with hair I kind of wanted to rip out and put on my own head (but not really b/c that would be psycho scary). She gave me a killer scalp massage that temporarily made me catatonic.  Then off to the chair.  

We quickly talked about what I wanted.  I'm pretty laid back, told her about my interview, and said ""just use your judgement"".  I have thin, curly hair, and I'm plus sized which basically equals 3 challenges.  Margeaux took off some length, gave me some layers, and basically made my curls perk up for the first time in almost a year. We talked, she cut, and before I knew it we were done.  On my way out, the receptionist gave me a deluxe product sample.  Score!

On such short notice and for the price of $45 (minus tip), I couldn't be more satisfied!  If I get the job, it'll definitely be in part to Margeaux and the staff at MCN!",3,ih6d7hBWss05xXWUznuFaw,4,5,2014-09-17,review,6

Their system is very intricate: They have hair cutters from different levels (I think up to 5?), which they discuss with you over the phone. Since it was my first time, and I wasn't going in for anything complicated like a color or styling, I went with level 2 and the young woman that cut my hair was highly capable and extremely nice. All the workers were actually very welcoming and everyone seemed like they were on top of everything. They were good at recommending products, without jumping down your throat, and were productive about seeing if I wanted to schedule a future appointment to freshen my cut weeks later. I believe my cut was $40 and I tipped $20. They only take cash or check for the tip just to give you a heads up!

The parking is super easy since it's in this plaza-like area with Chipotle, T-mobile, Dinette and other retail stores. There's also a Starbucks downstairs of MCN so it's a really nice and convenient location!

4356,F-c0ssyHi3JzU7zicqpIIg,hMae3xAn4HP4FTZsQpuC8Q,"I've been having my hair done at MCN Salon for the last four years. Unfortunately after today they will no longer be receiving any business from me.  I scheduled over a month in advance to go blonde for an upcoming Wedding. However when I arrived they explained that I had been 'double-booked' and a young apprentice would be applying my color instead. In itself that wasn't much of a problem, but when I asked if she wasn't going to bleach it first she looked at me like I had two heads. 

I was then told that they didn't have the time to bleach/dye my hair and I had to reschedule, which given my schedule constraints due to work and the upcoming wedding, wasn't possible. This is after over a month of waiting, four appointment confirmations (they message you to confirm your appointment by cell and e-mail), and budgeting for even longer (MCN is not a cheap salon). What is the point of all of those confirmations by cellphone, email, smoke signal etc. if it is just going to be mis-booked & overbooked anyway? 

The way the stylist explained the bleaching process to me was also pretty condescending considering the circumstances. When I scheduled the appointment I clearly expressed what I wanted done, cleared my schedule, and was ready to pay top dollar for the service. Your salon mishandled my appointment, I'm basically being told 'tough luck' right before a big wedding, and now you're going to complain that going from a light brunette to blonde just takes so much time and is just so much work? I'm sorry I thought this was a top class salon. I guess I was mistaken.



In short, this experience kind of ruined the salon for me, but to be completely fair I was pretty happy with their service until now. I wouldn't recommend this salon for color however if you're younger or looking for something more than a basic dye-job and make certain that your appointment is booked correctly beforehand. As a side-note their tipping policy is also outdated and nonsensical. Make sure to bring cash.",0,ih6d7hBWss05xXWUznuFaw,0,3,2014-11-01,review,2

I started coming to MCN after I had my hair colored and cut by someone who absolutely destroyed my hair. I had asked for an ombré and ended up with a poop brown and bleach blonde wreck. The next morning I called MCN praying they could fit me on for a corrective color. They got me in with Leslee that afternoon.  

I have linked some pictures but I don't know if they do her work justice. I went from having patches of bleached hair to the long ombré that I'd hoped for. Leslee spent hours on my hair color. It involved dying the roots the correct color, bleaching my end pieces blonde, and then toning the blonde from crazy yellow bleached to golden. 

She took my hacked long layers and blended them while leaving as much length as possible. I was already overwhelmed with the change in color I was so glad she was able to salvage my length. 

I left that day with the hair cut and color I wanted in the first place and I was so so grateful! I've been going to Leslee since and I think she does an amazing job. Last time I saw her I ended up ditching the ombré and going to a ""fall"" color. I wanted deeper brown with red. It's literally exactly what I asked for. 

I've also gotten an up-do for an event. I've never gotten so many compliments. And my long, heavy, thick hair stayed up all night. I've never had an up-do last as well. 

The salon is beautiful. The staff is helpful. And Leslee is the best! I highly  recommend MCN and Leslee. 2 co-workers of mine now go to her and they are both very happy as well!",2,ih6d7hBWss05xXWUznuFaw,0,5,2014-11-09,review,1

I tried looking on Yelp to identify if any salons downtown offer it, but with no success. So off I went, and I stumbled upon Kenny's Nail Center/Salon. Apparently right now they are the only nail salon in downtown Pittsburgh that has shellac. 

At first, I passed it b/c I didn't see any bright flashing lights saying shellac, but then I did a double take b/c on the window there is a small poster advertising that they do shellac. So I went in to confirm that they do shellac and to get the costs - as some of you know it can be pricey. 

They did confirm they did shellac and that without a full manicure that the cost would be $25 (slight grooming and painting only). I'm not sure how much the manicure and shellac would cost, but I thought $25 was a good deal for getting a 3-week polish job. And from what I heard it usually costs $35-40 bucks a pop. 

They were very busy and asked if I could come later in the afternoon around 2:15 PM (I went there initially at 12:30 PM) and I said that was fine - luckily I have some flexibility with work. So around 2:00 I departed work to go back to Kenny's. It seemed even more crowded so I was worried that I'd be overlooked, but they asked what I was there for and I said shellac and they said, ""oh yes, 2:15 sit down"" and pointed towards a nail chair. 

So I sat down and was greeted by Kammy - she was super nice and did an awesome job. I get a bit worried about some of these nail places cause they can do a pretty crappy job, but Kammy took her time (although it was clear she was very busy and people were waiting to see her). 

She's the only one in the salon that does Shellac and she is there on Thurs., Fri, and Sat. So for my downtown working ladies (or men if you're in to that sort of thing) in the house - stop by and see Kammy to get a polish job that will be chip and smudge free for 3 weeks! 

My nails look aaaaawesome! I got the bright pink color - I think it's called tutti fruity! 

Oh and there was also a cute little girl that helped out after Kammy was essentially finished who put the oil on my cuticles and did the alcohol finishing step to make the nails all glossy. Be a star and make sure you tip her as well!",4,oH-N5ONrsWK8jWuq8p653w,2,4,2011-07-01,review,10

They don't use razors here, which is fine, but I expected a thorough scrubbing of my callouses, and when she gave me a tiny little once over then unceremoniously threw my feet back into the water I thought to myself, OK there's no way on earth this is more than a $10 pedicure right? My heels still looked as bad as they did when I walked in. 
Then she painted my nails and sat me down at the ""dryer"" which consisted of two tiny fans pointed at my feet. For real.

Anyway, here's the skinny: SoHo is a great bar to watch games (as mentioned by the other reviewers), an OK place to eat, and the service is fantastic. If it were just based on drinks/service/viewing, I would give it a 4 or 5 stars rating. The food drags it down a bit.

I've been to SoHo about 20 times (as I frequently stay in the hotel above it), and they have a decent beer selection and a very good/knowledgable bar staff. The bar can get extremely packed on game days, as it is literally across the street from PNC Park (and a short walk from Heinz Field). On an off-night, though, it usually has a moderate crowd that trends toward the 30-something ""hip"" groups (it's not a college bar, nor a neighborhood pub).

As far as food, it's really hit-and-miss. Once I had Buffalo Chicken Pierogis, and they were awesome. I've also had a Tuna Steak Sandwich there that was great (if I remember correctly, it had some sort of chipotle or wasabi mustard on it that was yummy). However, as I ate there last night, I saw the lower end of the spectrum. I had a shrimp/scallops pasta dish (Diablo Pasta?), and it was not spicy at all (despite being advertised as such). It was just OK (the ingredients, other than the sauce, were pretty good, but the sauce was just passable). A friend of mine said that the French Onion soup was awful (way too much oregano, he said), and his ""sirloin"" sandwich was not sirloin. So I would just say it's either inconsistent, it has gone downhill, or there are just a few things that they do well.

The service, however, is fantastic. No matter how busy they are, the staff is very attentive and friendly (I've never had to wait long for a beer). I've also had quite a few drinks, over my visits, ""on the house"", which doesn't happen very often anywhere else. They also know a bunch of bartending ""tricks"" that they will do on request (like the Bailey's/Yager ""switching shot glasses"" one).

One last note is that it is usually pretty smoky in there, so be prepared to have your clothes reek after you leave (which, sadly, is the norm for Pittsburgh).

After a morning at the Aviary, we stopped here for lunch before heading over to the Phipps Conservatory. I'd never tried this place before, so I wanted to stop in. Catherine was hungry--she said she could have eaten cardboard at that moment and it still would have tasted good! 

Luckily, she didn't have to go that route and the food here was much better than cardboard! 

We began our lunch by splitting an order of Angry Shrimp. Angry Shrimp is very spicy (as its name implies) and is served over chilled pasta. For my main course, the Apple Raspberry Salad sure was tempting, but my blood sugars were running high (I'm a type-1 diabetic) and I already had my carbs with the pasta. I wanted a burger as a second choice, but their burgers are 1/2 pound and I knew I couldn't finish one. Plus I didn't want to schlep leftovers on the bus. So I opted for a Chicken Cobb Wrap, which was tasty enough. 

For the life of me, I can't remember what Catherine ordered, but she did remark that the food was good. She tried the Penn Pilsner beer, which she loved. I don't drink, but unsweetened brewed ice tea with a little lemon in it really hit the spot.

Is it a nod to Pittsburgh's very own SoHo? Lord, I hope not. The restaurant has far more glam than the rundown neighborhood trapped between Duquesne University and South Oakland. But I guess Depressing Shithole doesn't have a good ring to it, either.

Whatever the story behind its namesake is a moot point upon experiencing the restaurant's fare. Here's what you can expect:

1. Meh food. The SoHo steak and cheese is essentially chopped steak and Cheez Whiz on a bun. It's not particularly delicious. The fries were good, though.

2. Outstanding drinks. Perfectly priced, elegantly presented, and expertly mixed. The Cinnamon Toast Crunch martini is ridiculously delicious. Honest to God, it tastes like a friggin' bowl of the cereal. Except with alcohol.

Ok, then, did you ever realize, that months later, you're still thinking about something you ate there?  And then you start to think, ""Hey, maybe that was better than ok, since I'm still thinking about it...""

It's kind of like a movie that you're luke warm on, until you realize that you're still thinking about the movie two days later, and then you're like, ""Actually, I guess the movie was better than I thought, because I'm still thinking about it two days later.""   

Yeah, this place is kind of like that.  We went there back in October.  We had just driven about 6 hours from Jersey to Pittsburgh, we got in kind of late and hungry, and decided to get something to eat here because it was so close to our hotel (and I did not want to get back in the car and drive somewhere.) 

They had a good drink special (a couple of dollars for a margarita), and we got sandwiches and burgers.  Nothing amazing, but they hit the spot.  But, here's the part I'm still thinking about... they had a special that included the option of sweet potato tater tots.   Sweet Potato... Tater Tots.  Is that redundant?  Should it be Sweet Tater Tots?  I don't know, but I do know they were willing to substitute them with my sandwich even though I wasn't getting the special.  And I do know they were goood.  

So, now I'm a 6 hour drive away, it's two months later, and I'm still thinking about those Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  And, for that, I'm giving this place 4 stars.  

SoHo is really close to PNC Park, and not too far from Heinz Field.  They also deliver (""room service"") to the two hotels right there, Spring Hill Suites and Residence Inn.  Ask for the sweet potato tater tots.

As for me, I'm left wondering if sweet potato french fries (the more common menu cousin of the Sweet Potato Tater Tot) can ever truly be an adequate substitute, or if I need to go out and buy myself some sweet potatoes and try to tot them myself...",2,FtjvnLhh51ZBYEpKAARaFQ,1,4,2010-12-23,review,3
4381,RpPnxWsGkvgtMr7ZlzxGMg,L6mWs9lY4zsj6Hcu__RBAw,"Hotel restaurant/bars are usually not known for being the best in town.  So when I had the opportunity to eat and drink at SoHo recently, I can not say I was surprised that I found the cuisine to be on the uninspiring side.  Is it terrible?  No,  but you know that better is out there.  

The blackened chicken wrap was boring.  The flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland.  Also, white tortillas just do not do it for me.  Why does it seem that Pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty, flavorless food?

Upon ordering the caesar salad on New Year's Eve, I was told that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.

On the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.  The turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.

I also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).

The drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  

Service on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.

There are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  

I think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?  

Pro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.

I visited for the first time yesterday evening. My boyfriend and I decided to stroll over the bridge to catch some Jazz Live in Katz Plaza (Roger Humphries - really good show) and then headed to North Shore for some grub. Now, I don't find any of the restaurants near PNC to be that good (see my Bettis Grill review) so I knew we weren't going to find anything spectacular. We settled on Soho because I'd never been there before and Atria's doesn't appeal to me.

I did like the open layout on the inside of the restaurant. Looks like a perfect place to catch a game. Finally - a halfway decent TV setup, Pittsburgh! The bar is ginormous and they seemed to have an extensive liquor and beer selection. The draft selection was lacking, but they did have quite a few choices in bottles, if that doesn't bother you. I did not check their wine list, but I know they do have one.

My boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and I got a cheddar burger. My first thought: ""These two things should never be on a menu together."" He said the stir fry was so-so. Ingredients were spot on, but it was lacking any real flavor. Someone mentioned this place as being a runner for best burger in town - huh?? There are a number of places I would put before Soho's: Winghart's, Burgatory, even Olive Or Twist! My cheeseburger tasted like a frozen Bubba Burger from the grocery store (you know the ones ... ). It wasn't terrible perse, but it wasn't particularly good, either. It was just so-so. The cheddar cheese on it was not very appealing - it tasted like one of those individually wrapped Kraft slices. Onion rings were tasty, but I've rarely, if ever, had bad onion rings.

I would visit this place again if my focus were more so on watching a game and drinking than actually eating. Otherwise I say pass. In fact, skip into town over eating in the north shore at all.",0,FtjvnLhh51ZBYEpKAARaFQ,0,2,2012-06-27,review,1

Didn't feel like doing that so I ate at the hotel restaurant. 

I had a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich for lunch that was just ok. Not recommended since there are so many more items on the menu to choose from. Not sure why this simple dish wasn't better -- you'd think a restaurant in PA would know how to make a decent cheese steak sandwich. 

Had a local seasonal brew that was interesting but wasn't good enough to order two so I followed it with a Blue Moon which is always good. 

For dinner I had some chili which again was good but not great. They cover it in cheese like a French Onion soup which was interesting but the chili itself could have been a lot better. 

I also had a chicken quesadilla which is in the appetizers list but was very good as a dinner item. I'd have that again. Big chunks of chicken and tasty.

Soho is one of the more popular choices because it is fairly close and has a wide variety of menu items.

The biggest issue is that it is hit or miss on all accounts.  There are times I've gone and service has been exceptional where we were easily in and out in an hour.  There were other times that it was time to walk back to the office and our food had not yet even arrived.  The food quality is the same way.  There are times that everything is perfect and tasty.  There are other times where everything in the order seems to be wrong and taste off.

One downside is the price.  For the type of restaurant it is, the prices seem a bit high.  That being said, it is a restaurant located in a hotel and next to a stadium, so I suppose they may feel justified in their higher prices.

Now, they call themselves the ""Orginal"" fish market - but don't let that fool you. This place is an overpriced clone of legal seafood - with a good but overpriced service bar. Seriously.... $26 for two MGD beers and a double Bailey's on the rocks? Oy. Something tells me they want to loose business, rather than keep it. The wine selection is kinda dated, and I don't know the last time they cleaned the wine taps - but it looks to me like something I'd rather avoid- or have the bottle delivered to my table to avoid cross contamination.

The food, while basicially good (fried seafood) everything - is way overpriced to me. And there is no really good way to put this, but if you're looking for Fish and Chips - cross the street and go the the nearby Tonic restaurant. The portion size and the service are much better.

Nevertheless, this place in the Westin hotel is no different.  For starters, the place is sorely outdated.  The decorations look like they're straight out of an 80's music video.  I went with my mom, who asked me if the glass sculptures on the ceiling where Chihuly's.  I almost choked on my bread when she asked! 

I always go for sushi when it's on the menu at a fish place.  I can't get away from it, plus I need my weekly (or sometimes daily) fill of it!  So I ordered a spicy yellow tail roll and a ginger salad.  The spicy yellow tail was not spicy.  It had a side of ""spicy"" sauce.  I'm not too sure that qualifies it to be spicy with a dab of sauce.  The salad's ginger dressing was awful and watery.  I love ginger dressing when it's done right.  But it was not happening at this place! 

The thing that really made me mad is that the place is overpriced to begin with.  My tiny yellow tail roll was more expensive ($7) than the fabu Penn Ave Fish Co ($5.50) rolls.  And DEF not as good!  My mom ordered a bowl of fish soup.  This ""bowl"" was a deep dish salad bowl and looked as if there was a small ladle size serving.  It was hardly halfway full.  That's all my mom had ordered for lunch.  It was pretty sad looking.  So she asked for a little more from the server.  The server said that's all she could give her because it was restaurant policy.  Now let me tell you....I've worked at restaurants.  I've witnessed the people who eat their ENTIRE meal, then say it was bad and want another one...and they get another one!  Now that's messed up!  Asking for a little more soup, that's supposed to be a BOWL but looks more like a spoonful is hardly too much to ask for. 

Needless to say, I will NOT be back. There are WAY better fish places in the city to fill my belly with, hands down! Go to Penn Ave Fish Co, It's opened a new location right on Fifth Ave! Don't say I didn't warn you!",2,z4cCguoHdU48pj6sXMIzqg,3,1,2011-03-31,review,4

I visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday to use up a Groupon.  Thank God I didn't pay full price for this slop.  

First, lets talk about the decor.  Others have commented about the outdated 80s look of the place. I concur.  The chairs are ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable.  And don't even get me started on the hideous glass constructions hanging from the ceiling.  

Second, let talk about the staff.  Unprofessional to say the least.  When we were waiting for our table, I witnessed the hostess yell at a man from across the restaurant, instead of walking up to him and guiding him to his party.  ""Hey Anthony, your party's over here!""  Ridiculous. 

This restaurant has an open kitchen, which is usually a good thing - but not when everyone's yelling at each other.  We were seated near the kitchen and, I'm not exaggerating, heard someone yell ""order!"" approximately every 30 seconds.  Staff yelled at each other from across the restaurant constantly.  I felt like I was on a playground.  

Our waitress was a nice, sweet girl, and she did the best she could considering the environment she was in.  I have no complaints about her.  

The food, though... Jesus.  We started with the ""margarita shrimp cocktail"".  Imagine tiny round pieces of popcorn shrimp floating in a glass of lime flavored water.  These were served with tortilla chips, which you'd think were meant to be used to scoop up the shrimp from the glass.  But, the shrimp are solid round balls, not a scoopable salsa.  We tried picking up the shrimp with the chips, but they'd just roll off and end up on the floor.  My date and I just laughed as we TRIED to eat this concoction.  When it finally made it into our mouths, it was gross anyway.  

My boyfriend ordered a sushi/sashimi combo platter.  I'm being generous by giving it a rating of mediocre.  Take out sushi from a grocery store is better.  

Now, I admit, I made the mistake here - I ordered the fried fish platter.  I'm used to getting a variety at seafood restaurants.  At a place like Mitchell's Fish Market, you can get a dish with a piece of fish, a few scallops, a few shrimp, and a vegetable.  The Original Fish Market has no such dish.  The only dish I could get that had more than just one piece of fish with some plain steamed white rice and steamed spinach, was the fried fish platter.  So, I ordered that, with a side of green beans (vegetables were $5 - $7 extra).

The description said I would get a piece of tilapia, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and french fries.  I didn't realize this meant that the tilapia was fried, the scallops were fried, the oysters were fried, and the shrimp was fried, all on top of a giant bed of fried french fries.  It's just not what I pictured.  Like I said, it was my mistake for not reading carefully and not asking the waitress, but lets say for argument's sake that this is what I wanted.  

It was still disgusting.  The batter/flavor was exactly the same for everything.  The scallops tasted like the french fries.  The shrimp tasted like the french fries, the tilapia tasted like the french fries.  I didn't even try the oysters, but I'm pretty sure they would have tasted like french fries.  I ate barely a quarter of this dish, and I'm pretty sure I consumed an entire week's worth of saturated fat.  If you ate this entire plate, I think a heart attack would interrupt your dessert.

The green beans were good. 

Other people commented that you can't count on hotel restaurants being worthwhile.  I have to agree.  If everyone's just passing through, you don't have to worry about actually impressing anyone and getting them to come back.  And with business travelers, they're usually paying with their company's dime, so they don't bother to complain or expect much.

The third time, the chef's special ""coriander-crusted fluke"" came out as a couple slabs of tasteless fish coated in bread crumbs and oil and tossed onto a pile of dry couscous, and they served me the wrong salad.

Service: most of the staff here don't seem to respond well to ordinary social cues.  For instance, standing at the podium for two minutes probably means I want to be seated, not looked at and ignored by two different waitresses.

We've been to the OFM twice now... the first visit was acceptable, but the second was absolutely terrible.  We had late reservations for a quick bite after a lovely night at the O'Reilly to celebrate my husband's birthday.  As sushi lovers, we thought this would be a great way to end the celebration.

I stopped by here two nights ago on a work trip to grab some food.  The wine that I ordered was out (which was fine) and substituted - but for a place with a giant wine cellar I wouldn't suspect that should be an issue for the glass wines.

When I went to order I asked the server how the scallops were - and asked her to be honest.  She said that they are the most well done in Pittsburgh.  Well I think she meant that literally because the scallops were as tough as a tire and there presentation was poor with a pile of over salty spinach and some kinds of blobs smeared around the plate.  I was a little bummed about my experience when the 55 dollar bill came for one entree and a glass of wine.

Also a one off thing but the overhead light on the table was like a 10K watt surgical spotlight.  It actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright.

The service was great. We sat at the bar and in no time both bartenders greeted us with smiles and menus. I guess my main concern was the food quality. I ordered the beet salad with warm goat cheese (was not warm at all) and shrimp and scallop linguine. Both were not unique in flavor or presentation. It was as if I made it in my own kitchen. My boyfriend enjoyed his lobster bisque and his seafood jambalya that was perfectly spicy.

I do applaud the venue for offering a diverse and affordable wine list. And, with all due respect to owners, I think the atmosphere needs a serious update in character and aesthetics.

OK, I'm pretty sure Pittsburg isn't the most awesome place for sushi, but let's give it a shot! I started with the gumbo, which came out warm and kind of bland. It wasn't good at all. And then I had a roll, which was decent. And a spicy scallop roll. Now, everyone has their own take on spicy scallop, but this was by far the furthest from what I could imagine a spicy scallop roll could be. 

It was a small roll cut into 6 pieces (maki). It had a very small amount of raw scallops, which didn't taste super fresh. Then the roll was topped with the ""spicy"". I can't identify exactly the spices that were on top, but I've had this type of spice combination on other Japanese dishes. So I know it's an off the shelf thing. Basically, this was the worst roll I could imagine.

Our server was very helpful and gave us some suggestions on what to order. We asked about what sushi rolls we could start off with as appetizers for the group, and he suggested two that worked very well. They were both tuna-based, one mild and one spicier. It definitely lives up to the claim that OFM has some good sushi.

We then ordered our mains, and I got the cioppino. Now, I'm used to cioppino coming out as a stew with chunks of fish in a broth, but OFM's chef has decided to serve an entire slab of mahi on a thin layer of the broth with the accompanying shellfish. The dish was cooked well, but the presentation (lack of actual stew) left me wanting for more.

The caesar salad was pretty good, with actual anchovies on top.

My girlfriend ordered from their sushi lunch special and I ordered the bison burger. You're probably asking why order that when at a fish market. Well I originally planned on fish but I hadn't had bison in a while and it caught my eye. Well the menu is a bit pricey and I don't mind paying for good food so I had high expectations. He bison burger was mediocre (took a star away) The menu said bacon, but none showed up. No worries probably better for me. I felt at $15 for a bison burger this thing should freaking be awesome. Not the case. I would put it at $8.99-$9.99 price range I would pay since they gave me chips as a side. So they lost another star for over priced for the value I received. The girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu. Two basic rolls and miso soup for $16. This would easy go for $14 at other places during lunch. So ultimately would I give it another shot? Yes, but only if it is convenient. I would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place.

Some martinis are about $10, which is fine for a stellar top shelf martini in Pittsburgh or an average martini in NYC.  This is not a stellar Pittsburgh martini.   I believe that any bar whether its in your basement or at the ""French Laundry"" should have guinness on tap (just my personal belief), and this place at least has guinness but serves it out of a can.  Another annoying thing is depending on who serves me I pay a different price.  Last night I paid $7 for a guinness (which is way too much) and then minutes later I ordered another one from a different bartender and paid $5.25.  The food is two stars at best and very inconsistent.  They bill themselves as a ""tapas"" place, but it is obvious to me they don't understand what ""tapas"" entail.  Go to ibiza on the s. side for your tapas.  Some of their selections are better than others.  I've had the quail before which was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  Last night I tried the AHI tuna which was of good quality, but could have used some wasabi or a stronger flavored sauce to compliment the good quality tuna.  I also tried the lobster cakes.  The lobster was barely noticable and the cakes had way too much breading.  The best thing about the plate was the curry sauce on the side.  I'd have to say that the location and space of the restaurant is 4 stars, but the food is 2 stars at best.  Another weird thing is that I've been here before on more than one occassion when they simply said they were not serving food (and it was like 8 on a Friday).  They need an overhaul of the chef staff.",1,sbTF0cLKZH6_BP8BLARVDg,0,3,2008-04-17,review,1

I was disappointed that they used ""mojito mix"" for their seemingly very popular mojito - but at least they had freshly mashed mint. The martinis are generous, but you pay the price for them. Enjoy your measly $1 off at happy hour during the week, but I don't blame them. Why have a better happy hour when you're already making money hand over fist? 

This is a fun place to hang out but expect to spend lots of money if you stick around. The atmosphere is probably the best for a downtown bar, but the crowd is surely on the older side. 

Unfortunately, they still allow smoking, but the place is big and airy enough that it's not so much an issue.

It can get a bit pricey if you have a tab open and aren't thinking about what your drinking and how much the drinks are.  The drinks are made reasonably well, by that I mean they have enough alcohol in them so that you don't have to wonder why you just paid $10 for ice, water, and a splash of alcohol.  

Back in the day Bossa Nova was a novel idea for this town, but now with all these upscale bars/lounges and restaurants opening they may have to reinvent themselves somehow.

I enjoy the music, but will sit back and let the ""pros"" do the dancing. They have friendly service, a few outdoor tables and a huge bar. It's a pretty lounge-y vibe. 

There is a decent wine/beer list, and also specialty cocktails. Both times, I tried the sushi, which was not bad at all - not comparing to a Japanese restaurant, but for a bar it was done well. The spicy one was really hot, topped with a jalepeno: nice touch. I also ordered the house salad, which was a meal in itself. Seriously it was huge!

For tapas, I had the fig and goat cheese toastas. Boy chose the stuffed peppers. Strangely, my food arrived about fifteen minutes before the peppers.

I wasn't about to pre-order food for a casual birthday get together. So, figuring they'd probly be very busy on a Friday night, we got there around 4:30. There were MAYBE 6 people around the bar. No one in the lounge seating area. I sort of felt undervalued as a customer for not being able to reserve space when no one was there. 5:30 came around, the bar got a little busier, but no where near the packed house crowd they painted as a picture for me when I tried making reservations.

4534,Sue6ZMVoc08_KDhV26V_Jw,W3T5JvFBuGWZnWiwJWZiaA,"First impression:
The guys here were borderline rude to me when I dropped my car off. I thought I had talked to someone on the phone and made an arrangements. It turns out there are two Monro Muffler locations on Penn Ave and no employee at either shop thought to bring this up (then, or at any point), as I had called the wrong location (I found out days later).

Service:
They took my car in anyway and said ""they'd get to it tomorrow"", well tomorrow became the next day and the day after... 

Got a call that the mufflers I bought for the car turned out to be the wrong ones so I called around, tracked down the right ones, and dropped the correct ones off there within two hours of the call.

Quality of work:
All in all it took a week for them to get the work done and I was under the impression they would be welding the whole system together. It turns out they just use clamps and bolt stuff together. I asked them to make me some tail pipes for me with bends over the rear axle and they couldn't do it with 2.5"" pipe, turns out they are incapable of bending anything over 2"" pipes there. Instead we agreed it would be easiest for them and cheapest to install short turndown pipes. So really it wasn't a terribly difficult job to be done.

Overall impression:
I gave two stars instead of one because they didn't actually break anything or lose my car or burn it down or anything. Pricing came in just over what we had agreed on because of the addition of the turndown pipes. I could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself.",0,D5AC_cRdXrSWqL8KjJt5KA,0,2,2013-07-22,review,0

I really liked the fact that we had no problem getting a seat at the bar or a table.  I usually go to the bars on the North Shore prior to Pirates game, but this was a lot less crowded and good for the group I was with.  In fact, truth be told the place was only about 1/2 full (on Bucs opening day!?).  The food was okay.  I tried these nachos which were good and interesting because it had a decent quality sausage as the meat and not just ground beef.  I also really liked the sweet potato fries.  They were delicious and you usually can't get these at too many places.  I ordered the lobster roll.  It was a ton of lobster, however some of the lobster was a little overcooked and it was ice cold.  I can understand serving cool even though Id prefer warm, but ice cold really wasn't that good when they put warm butter on it.  I also tried the tortilla soup, which was really rich and had a good spicy flavor.  The only thing missing in the tortilla soup was the tortilla chips.  A minor oversight I imagine.  Overall, a pretty decent place when you are looking to just have a few beers with friends.  I've also tried the upstairs bar which is the more upscale section.  The bar is huge which is good plenty of room, and their is plenty of seating including leather couches.  The happy hour is okay, but it's pretty much a ghosttown after 8 PM.

Near the Lemongrass Cafe and the Renaissance Hotel, It's a cozy little bar; it's narrow and has an exposed-brick, jazz-house type of feel to it.
Very dimly lit, a great little spot for an evening drink before or after a show in the Cultural District of Pittsburgh!

Obviously, their specialty is going to be martinis and they do a nice job of offering up traditional martinis as well as some fruity, tasty, sweet martinis.

They also serve food and have a nice sized menu; I've never had the opportunity to eat here, but some of the things that were coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled delish!

The crowd here is typically young, trendy and professional.
By Day, its a great spot for suits to grab a quick cocktail and something to eat.
By 4:30, its filling up with more suits and skirts, for the after-work crowd in downtown.
By the evening, you'll have the trendy, young types.
(I'm also fully convinced that this is where trendy wanna-be types will go to dress up, as-if they were at work for the day, and then go to hang out to rub elbows with those who actually do work!  lol)

This is a great place to go before or after baseball games, theater shows, and just because.

PROS:
Atmosphere is a pro, here.  Pretty laid back, IMO;
Great idea-inducing drink menu if you have no idea what you'd like to drink;
Lots of suggestions if you want to ""try something new"";
Also serves food.

CONS:
Parking is terrible (as with all things, Pittsburgh.  Try the garage across from the Renaissance Hotel);
eh... a tad bit pricey for ""just a lot of vodka"", lol;

While here, we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini.  The blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum. As a strong drink, it was good. However, the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink. For the cucumber basil martini, the basil is the primary flavor in the drink and kills any undertones of the cucumber. The sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing.

Why? I moved up here from Orlando to be with my boyfriend who I had just started dating. I moved because Orlando on a whole sucks and I was ready to get out. My boyfriend used to play in a band as does one of his best friends now. This was their favorite spot to hang out out because all of the (female) bartenders know and love them. They used to get free or greatly reduced drinks, could be as loud and obnoxious as they wanted, etc. etc. - the ush. 

I tag along now because I didn't know many people in this city at first, obviously. The bar is way too small for the number of people who try to pack in at night. I've had several items off of the menu and they all left a lot to be desired. The drinks are poured strongly. At first I thought this was because the bartenders knew how the boys liked their drinks, but now I realize they're just heavy handed. 

Nothing here really sticks out for me. I can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price. Same with the food. I guess the only reason I agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - Amy and Linda. Those two are the most kick ass bartenders in Pittsburgh. Considering I currently live in Heinz, it's also pretty damn close, which works in its favor (can't wait to move ... ). 

Olive or Twist has a great location and, if Amy and/or Linda are working, you're sure to enjoy yourself. Just keep those expectations low.",1,OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw,2,1,2012-06-21,review,2

We went upstairs and there was no room, so we went back down and asked her to push the tables together so we could eat and drink merrily, which she did reluctantly.  The service wasn't the best, and the food was okay, but the drinks were good.

So I strolled over and walked in.  First impression was it was a cool, cozy, and trendy joint.  Liked the exposed brick walls, lighting, etc.  Only problem is, I don't go to a restaurant or a bar to eat and drink the atmosphere!

So I grab a table in the bar.  It was about 5pm and there might have been 15 people in the whole place.  Two bartenders made eye contact with me so I figured they would be waiting on me.  I figured wrong.  I sat there for a good ten minutes and was getting ready to get up and leave when the younger tender came over and said with a ""deer in the headlights look"", do you want a drink or something????  Well hell, what was your first guess?  I refrained from quoting Foxworthy and saying ""here's your sign""!

So OK we were off to a bumpy start.  I didn't have a martini, however there was a few options on the drink menu.  I was just here for a bite, so my review is based on that.

A few minutes later the other bartender comes back with my water and gives me a menu.  I ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side.  I say ""some"" turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive!  

It seemed to take forever for it to arrive.  Given the fact that it wasn't busy, it did take a long time to arrive.  When it did, it looked OK.  The fruit salad looked as if it was ready for the trash, so I bypassed that.  The wrap just had zero flavor and was loaded with lettuce........way to much.  The only flavor that presented itself was blandness!  It was very disappointing.

Since we weren't sure what to get and were just generically hungry, we decided to just let the menu decide for us and we ordered one of each of the highlighted items on the menu - the ""house specials"" according to our server.

The calamari was excellent and it was apparent that it had been hand breaded.  The Asian fusion made for a delicious alternative to the typical calamari that was reminiscent of a General Tso's squid.  The main dishes were also good, but nothing in particular stuck out about them.  I also had a red-velved martini which I thought was probably the best part of the meal.

Overall, I would definitely go back on a weeknight for happy hour or on a Tuesday to try the variety of mini martinis, but I think I'll leave paying $9 for an alcoholic beverage to ""special"" nights and not just a typical weekend dinner.

They do lose a star because even though we were one of three occupied tables and a few taken seats at the bar, the service was incredibly slow.

I especially love how any sauces or dips with appetizers are usually served in a martini glass. It's a cute and well-thought touch.

The only drawback here is that Olive or Twist is pretty darn popular; this place gets very noisy after 4:00 very quickly, especially as the happy hour prices kick in.

While Olive or Twist is NOT a five star restaurant, it gets 5 stars from me because I love it.  Its one of the few places I know of that has been CONSISTANTLY good.  for years!  The interior is warm and a little bit industrial.  The downstairs is the same as it has always been and it's still very nice.

Then, I refused to let him even try it bc it was that good.  It was MINE.

I also had a cake batter martini which tasted great and came out looking so pretty I instagrammed a picture of it and immediately all my friends clicked like on it, and my one aunt commented I should drink less.  Whatever. She needs a martini.

Aside from that I tried the steak salad which was a major disappointment since the meat was gristly and tough. Overall stop in for your favorite wrap and a special flavored martini, but resist the temptation to try a new dish.",0,OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw,0,3,2013-09-07,review,1

 I was hoping to get a quick meal and a drink before the show. When we arrived the bar was packed and we were told that they had no availability to sit in the restaurant section. But, little can deter me. I scoped out the tables by the bar and noticed a couple getting ready to pay. After making casual chit chat, they agreed to save their table for us. They paid and left while we ordered a drink at the bar. As soon as they got up the waitress put a reserved sign on the table, I assumed it was for us and sat down. Nope. She was trying to reserve it for an 8pm reservation. I thought this was the bar area which is seat yourself? Oh well, I told her we had to be out by 8 for a show anyway so it would work out fine. A few minutes later she came back and told us no, that won't work and we will have to find a place at the bar. Seriously? We are already sitting in the seat yourself tables, it was fine 2 minutes ago, we have to leave by 8, what's the issue? Rather annoyed we looked for seats and ways to inch ourselves into the already overly crowded bar when the waitress returned and said she will reserve another table that was leaving. Now, we have wasted 10 minutes of our already limited time before the show so, I asked what was the fastest thing on the menu. We ordered soup, salad and the buffalo chicken spread. The soup arrived first. I had the homemade chicken noodle. Warm, comfort food that hit the spot. Next was the pear salad with candied walnuts, blue cheese and strawberry vinagerette.  Again, super tasty. I could snack on the candied walnuts all day. Then the buffalo chicken spread. Presentation was great-in a martini glass. The pita chips were delic! But where was the chicken? I searched through the entire martini glass, not one shred or chunk of chicken. Being a buffalo chicken dip lover, I was sorely disappointed.

I went here with a group of friends for a birthday, The fiance and I had dinner downstairs first and then went upstairs to the lounge.  If you are with a group, it's a pretty fun and chill place and they were playing good danceable music, which my friends and I liked.  It didn't seem that packed for a saturday, so it was easy to get a drink.  I think there's also servers walking around the lounge to take orders, so another plus.

The dining area was pretty small, but we made a reservation just about 2 hours prior to arriving, and we didn't have to wait. My fiance and I shared the calamari, which was really delicious!  Usually, the calamari we get is seasoned with just salt & pepper with maybe some breading at times and chilli and scallions, but this one was a different taste and it was tasty!  It seemed a little asian inspired kind of like sweet with some crumble and salty with soy.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad.  I liked the taste, but it isn't the best ahi to me.  Fish didn't taste that fresh to me.  My fiance had the braised short rib with the mashed potatoes and he said it was only 3 stars for him. He got his friend a turkey wrap and he said it was average.

4625,11Ydte1VfE85UHK24d4QRQ,XkyZAQAaGO9i3on-b3fswg,"Very disappointed.  I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of ""are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else""  Yes, I'm pretty sure I called the right restaurant...  She kept looking at the room of empty tables, looking at the book and then looking at us.  After a few minutes of back and forth, she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there.  So we trudged upstairs.  All that was available were small high top tables.  Being a Friday night, it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy.  Not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of it.
We started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer.  It is served in a martini glass with toasted/fried pita chips.  It was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was.  
The problems with food began with the pacing of the meal.  We had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out.  It may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs, but being at the high top bar tables, we had no room for our drinks, appetizer and meal.  We found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything.  It was frustrating.  Not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees.  
With as much as we enjoyed the appetizer, we were looking forward to our meals. Unfortunately, they were very disappointing.  My friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes.  Her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm.  When she mentioned it to the server, the server said ""so would you like me to take them back or are they ok""  When would cold mashed potatoes ever be OK?  When her potatoes were brought back warmed, she was disappointed because they were called ""garlic mashed"" but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at all.
I ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  It was described as ""grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices, pepper jack cheese, garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a Kaiser roll""  No mention of a tomato.  When I got the sandwich, there were three tomatoes on it.   Thankfully I just dislike tomatoes and it wasn't an allergy issue.  There was also no pineapple chutney.  When I asked about it, the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the roll.
Overall, very disappointed.  I wanted to love Olive or Twist because I really enjoyed the time I had visited for a drink, but the dining experience was sorely lacking, especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girl's night out.",1,OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw,0,1,2014-06-16,review,2

I ordered the ""Perfect Pear"" martini recently and it was very strong tasting compared to the other time I had it. You get your money's worth of alcohol in their martinis for sure! This definitely is not a place where you get a watered down drink. The place is dimly lit and the walls are dark, which makes for a comfortable setting, no matter how busy the bar is. There is live music, which is very good and isn't loud to the point that you can't hold a conversation with those around you. I would definitely recommend this place for their strong, unique martinis with a punch that will have you feeling it in no time, as well as for their dark ambiance and live music.

4637,MSuyK2p8G9hEqyWf5IgnYQ,UHECOLHhzzPTebtFjEPjbA,"Friday night out with one of my best friends and we were looking for a cool place to check out downtown. I always wanted to give this place a shot so we came here. The first floor was a little crowded , we arrived slightly before 6:00, so we headed up to their second floor and took some seats at the bar. 

Our bartender was very friendly. There weren't any signs or notes anywhere about happy hour specials, so I asked our bartender. I cannot remember everything that she stated, but I zoned in when she mentioned $2 off Martinis. I chose the cucumber basil martini and my friend did the same. Too strong for me- even with the basil infused vodka and fresh cucumber, my friend on the other hand found it light and refreshing. 

We weren't that hungry so we decided to split an appetizer and order salads. We split the chicken quesadilla appetizer and both ordered house salads. I modified my house salad to have feta rather than blue cheese and chose the strawberry vinaigrette as my dressing. 

The quesadillas were good, as far as chicken quesadillas go. The guacamole it was served with was awesome, although they didn't supply us with enough salsa, sour cream or guacamole for all four quesadillas. Or maybe I am just too obsessed with condiments, haha. 

The salad was yummy , I loved the vinaigrette! It was a decent portion as well. 

Although I enjoyed the experience, I do not think I will be returning. Two drinks, two salads and one appetizer cost is $50. The Martinis alone, even with their happy hour deal, were still $8 each. I don't mind spending $50 on a meal, but for how average everything was, that was entirely too much. 

Maybe I will return for a drink or two one day.",1,OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw,0,3,2014-09-21,review,1

My friend told me to pick wherever I wanted for a celebratory dinner, and Yelp brought me here.  The name was catchy, and the food looked cool.  And martinis are my drink of choice.  What's not to love?

We made reservations, but the bar upstairs was cooler so we went upstairs instead.  There are bar tables and couches and comfy chairs to hang out on.  The service was amazing, and we never wanted for anything.  Every need was met before we could even ask.

I started out with the Orange Dreamsicle martini, and while it was on the sweet side, it was delicious!  If I return, I will definitely get another one of these.  Not strong alcohol wise but yummy.

We ordered the scallops and Asian fusion calamari for appetizers.  My friend was super upset with the scallops and thought they tasted bad.  I don't really know anything about scallops so I ate them.  He complained to the manager, and the manager was nice enough to take 1/2 off, which I thought was really nice considering it wasn't stopping me from eating them.  (#PoorKidProblems).  The calamari was really unique but delicious.  The actual calamari was good, but it was covered in some sauce similar to stir fry sauce.  It was good, and the portion was a really fair size for the price.

I then moved onto the Key Lime Pie martini.  It was a let down after the Dreamsicle, but there was nothing wrong with it.  I personally preferred the first one.

My favorite food item was my entree.  I ordered the Penne ala Vodka, and when she put it on the table, I thought I had gone to garlic heaven.  Simple but wonderful.  There was also a very generous amount of asiago cheese on top of my pasta and a slice of prosciutto.  I took about half of the portion home, but I finished it off that night because it was so delicious.

I really loved this place, and on a Friday night, it was EMPTY.  I don't know if this was because of Labor Day weekend or a Pirates game, but we were the only people in the bar area by 8:00.  Hopefully it was just a fluke because I liked Olive or Twist!",7,OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw,2,4,2014-09-24,review,6

I have been here several times for tiny tini Tuesdays - a weekly event that allows you to sample their colorful and delicious martini's in tiny glasses.  You order three at a time for a somewhat steep $12.  If you want variety though, this is not to be underestimated.  

However, the food is always lacking.  I went on a lunch date here and decided to go for the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup as my stomach wasn't feeling up to anything more adventurous.  The grilled cheese was fine.  Nothing special.  The soup however had a thin drizzle of basil oil which when stirred in made the soup greasy and wholly unappetizing.

We arrived around midnight on a Friday (well, technically Saturday I guess) and there still was a decent crowd being the place is downtown. We ordered our drink upstairs and eventually made our way back downstairs and sat outside so my boyfriend and his friends could smoke. The upstairs is fairly big and definitely had enough room so you don't feel packed together. There is your basic bar seating, as well as couches and chairs that give it a lounge sort of feel. It didn't take anytime at all for a friendly bartender to notice us and take our drink order. 

They had a lot of really interesting sounding drinks, but we decided to go with the Pumpkin Spice martini because it's October (like, duh!!). Wow! Now, I'm not one for martinis as I have mentioned in previous reviews for other places, but this was amazing! The best martini I've ever had. So delicious and super easy to take down, yet you could still taste the alcohol so you know they didn't short you. 

After spending some time upstairs, we traveled downstairs to check out the first floor. There was definitely a different vibe. It was slightly older and not as bumping. I also got to take a peak at their menu because I would love to come back and try their food. 

As I mentioned above, we ended our night outside as they have a few tables and chairs. This is always the best because sometimes it's nice to escape the madness of a bar, especially if you're out with smokers.

It is served cold in a martini glass with warm pita chips and is just amazing! I've ordered several dishes and haven't had a bad meal either!

The only thing that lacks sometimes is the service, especially on my last visit. We were standing at the hostess stand for a couple of minutes and no one came over. Finally a girl did but she just looked at us, got something, and walked away. Not even a ""someone will be right with you"". Then another girl came over and said ""do you need a table?"". I wanted to respond with ""why would I be standing at a podium that says let us seat you"", but I refrained. We were seated, it took several more minutes for our drink order to be taken and it was subpar service the rest of the night. Waiting, waiting, and more waiting.

We went back in the main door, clearly confused. The bartender looked at us but kept pouring drinks (rude!). Not even sure how we discovered it, but the host stand was in the BACK of the restaurant. How were we supposed to know this? We were seated, and had to wait awhile for service.

Finally, the server came and took our drink orders and suggested a very strong drink for me. He was obviously trying to get me drunk (and succeeded). Caution: The Vesper is a strong *ss gin martini that is just okay. You pay 11 bucks to drink a shot of gin slowly from a fancy glass. 

He then took our order...and did not think to write any of the 8 requests down. Yep, you guessed it. He screwed up our orders and bills, then proceeded to be rude about the situation. 

The buffalo chicken dip is awesome, but be prepared, there is no chicken. We had one chunk in the two orders. The deep fried pita chips taste like donuts and are muy excellente. 

Also, prepare yourself for bartenders squeezing caramel into glasses. The sound is reminiscent of flatulence. Over and over. So much flatulence. 

I was too drunk and full of pita donuts to eat my dinner. The two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though.

Last night, Bobby and I found ourselves downtown to check out all of the Christmas activities, and on our way we passed Olive Or Twist. Having never been here, Bobby I asked if I would like to stop for drinks on our way out to dinner so we decided to stop in.

The first thing I noticed was how warm and inviting the atmosphere was. You could tell it was a totally fun bar, and everyone seemed to be having a great time. We somehow managed to grab a seat up at the bar and ordered off their specialty martini list.

If you're feeling festive, definitely order the cake batter martini! It was AMAZING! The chocolate rim with sprinkles was a nice touch. I also ordered a regular vodka martini, which was excellent. 

The only real drawback was that the service was really slow. It took awhile to get a drink menu, and then even longer to order.

When Carrie suggested that we grab some drinks, I suggested that we go to Olive or Twist because I'd been wanting to check it out for awhile. I rarely receive the opportunity to go out for drinks after shows because some of my friends who I attend shows with tire out early (lame) or don't really go to bars ever (even lamer), so I was excited to finally have the opportunity to imbibe a few in a classy setting downtown.

Given that it was my birthday, I knew exactly what I wanted drink-wise, thanks to Rachel C.'s review: the cake batter martini!  Thanks to other reviews, I was aware that O or T's specialty martinis are dessert-y drinks rather than your typical martini.  This was absolutely fine by me, since I enjoy sweeter digestifs later at night.  As can be seen from my photo, this martini comes with a rim of chocolate syrup spangled with multicolored decorative sprinkles, which made for a very festive--and delicious--birthday drink.  Once I finished it, I went for a second round and chose the mint chocolate martini, which also came adorned with chocolate syrup.  It tasted exactly like melted mint ice cream--my favorite kind.  Yum!

We sat at the upstairs side bar, and service from the bartenders was generally good--one of them even wished me happy birthday when I mentioned why I was ordering the cake batter martini.  While it was busy, it wasn't so crowded as to feel claustrophobic.  The noise level was a bit on the loud side--but then again, what bar isn't?

I really enjoyed my visit to O or T, and look forward to returning again, once I can convince my friends to stop by for a drink.  I'd love to check out the happy hour, in particular.

I don't mind O&T layout.  It's a bit chopped up but very Pittsburghese reminiscent of most establishments.  There is the upstairs where you can sit by the roaring fire on the 72"" flat screen or lounge on many of the couches or loveseats they have available.  There is also the downstairs that seems to have similar offerings, however at least in our experiences was a lot busier than upstairs.  I pick less busy almost every time. This time around we found three bar seats available upstairs and settled down for a couple drinks.  
I started with a Southern Tier XXX IPA, solid start to the evening.  I know they specialize in Martinis but I specialize in craft beer.

We both had an Olive or Twist Burger, and I chose sweet potato fries and requested a med rare cook.  We used the Yelp deal so it wasn't as expensive as it could have been, but the burger sells for $13.00.  I rarely complain about cost especially if it is good, however it really was not.  The meat was way overcooked and dry.  Surprisingly the fries were the best thing on the plate.  To spend that on a burger I do expect a better quality.

I think the total cost was $3 and Jimmy told us the story of how the sfogliatelle was created while chomping on his cigar.  Both of our items were good and both my fiance and I were espcially impressed with the sfogliatelle.  It had a lot more filling than we are used to getting as well as a more orangy flavor which made it extra good.  Honeslty she was just happy to find a good Sfogliatelle in Pittsburgh.

Finally the last time that we came was on a Saturday and so the whole store was open, not just the cart.  It was interesting to look around inside and see everything that I had been missing by walking past it all of these years. There were a number of display cases with a ton of baked goods in each of them and it also looked like they served a bunch of different lunch type items like sandwiches to go.  Jimmy once again waited on us and as always was super friendly and told us some stories that we enjoyed.  We ended up leaving this time with not only sfogliatelle for my fiance but also for her parents.

There are lots of articles in the newspapers, regular protests, petitions, etc over route reduction and fare hikes and so on. Some people think its slow, unreliable and overcrowded.

There's a general sense that its unfair that Pitt students ride for free while much of the Pitt staff do not. And, of course, the rest of the city has to pay too. 

But I think all this is just a testament to the health of the system. People - students at all the college and universities, long-term residents, downtown commuters, school kids - actually value and use the bus system. 

In other university towns (not to name names) the schools just give up entirely and shuttle their students around in private buses, which means, in the end, less ridership, fewer routes less frequently and less money for the public transportation. 

I also found the drivers to be considerate - especially of the elderly and disabled - and as helpful as they could be, given the demands on their time and attention.

2.  Reliable service.  If the schedule says a bus will arrive at a particular time, then the bus will arrive within about five minutes of that time.  If the schedule says buses arrive every 10 minutes, on average, then I expect to wait no more than about 15 minutes.
3.  Affordable fares and passes.  Because price is one of the only areas in which public transit has the potential to be directly and immediately more convenient to a person than individual car ownership, prices to passengers should be kept to a minimum.

(It's saved me more than once when, say, I realize that I forgot to grab my umbrella and have to run back into my apartment.) 

The main problem is when there are holes in the schedule where a scheduled bus just never arrives, probably due to technical problems. That's happened to me at least once per month, but it's not so pervasive as to be a major issue.

All in all, I've found the buses to be dependable and convenient. Pittsburgh has punishingly complex topography- it's full of craggy valleys, towering hills, and plenty of rivers and streams- so considering that there's nothing even CLOSE to a grid system, it's a major accomplishment to have a mass transit system set up so smoothly.",0,1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA,0,4,2010-03-14,review,0
4678,_DWxIyqYSAlBCm53xx1LKw,ADIeSQdAItEwq-DA25yilQ,"Port Authority (formerly known as PATransit, or ""PAT"") operates a fairly extensive network of buses and (in the South Hills) light rail. Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.

I've had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (""Miss Pat""--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a ""free"" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.

The system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.

The route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The ""oughts"" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three ""busways,"" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the ""T"" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.

The University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a ""smart card"" digital payment system (à la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.

One especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.

The Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.",1,1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA,0,4,2010-07-12,review,2

However, my main complaints are

1. The buses are way too crowded during rush hour.  Not only are the buses almost always so full that the standing room is occupied, but bus drivers some times even have to drive by peeved people at bus stations because the bus is completely full.  
2. Irregular intervals.  Buses have a tendency to bunch.  This some times results in having to wait at a bus station for a long time before seeing two buses together.  The lead bus is overcrowded and the second bus is usually pretty empty.  Note:  Bus bunching is a well-known phenomenon.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_bunching
3. Waiting outside in the cold for the bus.  Because of irregular intervals, you some times have to wait outside in Pittsburgh weather for significant time.

Pittsburgh needs to install GPS on their buses!  This has been implemented in Washington DC and San Francisco already.

4683,VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w,ZBCU0lepUid9L9eONElWOw,"I called Pittsburgh my temporary home three summers in a row. I went to the University of Pittsburgh for SLI: Summer Language Institute from '05-'07. The university, in an effort to accommodate out-of-state students as much as possible, provided ""free"" bus passes (these were factored into your cost of attending). With my full scholarship and pass, I had every intention of keeping this trip on the cheap by walking everywhere I could and using public trans for everything else.

My first experience with the Port Authority was taking the 28X Airport Flyer from the International Airport to the Oakland campus, which is roughly 20 miles away. The bus runs from 5:20am to 1:01am every day of the week. The opposite direction is just as convenient and starts at 4:25am with last pickup at 11:51pm. The trip takes about an hour and there are buses every 30 minutes or so. The drive is very scenic and gives you a good feel for all that Pitt has to offer.

Throughout the week students of Serbian, Russian and Bulgarian came together and went on little excursions to pass the free time. The major super market in the area is Giant Eagle (""Jynt Igel"", if you want to get local). There was one within walking distance of campus, but it was much more of an adventure to take the 61A, 61C or 61D to Squirrel Hill (""Skvirel"", if you want to get Slavic with it) and shop there. We also preferred this since the main street is lined with Greek, Russian and Jewish stores and restaurants. There is also a good number of family owned arts and crafts shops, handmade goods stores and other small businesses.

If we were feeling like we really wanted a change of scenery, we'd ride the 61C or 61D farther down SW and cross the Allegheny to Homestead, PA. There is a large shopping center with all the luxuries of corporate America from AMC Loews Waterfront 22 and Target to Chick-Fil-A and Dave & Busters. The distance is only 6 miles, but it always took forever and a day. You're looking at 45 minutes in perfect traffic conditions.

Another shopping option was the Southside Riverfront. It was a mere 3 mile ride and could be accessed by hopping on the 75 or 54. We rode it many times to visit H&M for cheap clothing and REI to get travel essentials (many students end up going abroad through their respective language programs). This area was also the place to be on weekends and has a number of eateries and dive bars.

One little known fact about SLI is that you are not saved by the bell. When class is over you are still a student of the linguistic arts and expected to practice as much as possible. This includes lunches with your professors and peers, dinner dates with other students, and cultural excursions. The American Serbian Club was considered the mecca of the language students, regardless of which language they were studying. It is also located in South Side, so the 75 or 54 will get you within blocks of its doorstep. Both run pretty frequently, all day and all night.

But my absolutely best memory of the Port Authority has to be my first day back in Pittsburgh in 2006. I had decided to skip staying in the dorms and opted to go even cheaper by renting an apartment nearby. I had just arrived and was getting to know my roommates. We went for a walk around campus and ended up somewhere just NW of the school. It started to downpour and as we were scurrying for cover, a little shuttle bus driver pulled over and offered us a ride. We asked him where he was headed and in perfect Pittsburghese he replied, ""Wherever yinz is a goin'.""",3,1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA,3,4,2011-06-02,review,4

I would not want to take the bus to get somewhere where I had to be there on time.  That seems like it'd be a mistake.  You can't really get one of these without waiting for a while.  Still, once you're on, they're cheap, comfortable enough, and the drivers are really helpful.  If you have questions about where you get off for what, they can answer them.

Here's the deal: I 100% blame Pittsburgh's bus system problems on Port Authority.  Between the winding bus routes, the inability of buses to show up on time, and the outrageous money spent on retirement plans, it should be disbanded.  The city needs to take over and reconfigure the entire system.  The Post-Gazette has printed some great pieces that explain how the system could be overhauled.

I've been a bus rider since birth (I still never drive), and it's only gotten worse over the years.  Some routes are great (outside of rush hours), others are ridiculous, and some good routes were recently cut.  Until transfers are free (which they should be within an hour window, in my opinion), it was insane to cut the 500, which added $10 a week to my bus tab just to get to work.

It is usable?  If you don't care about being on time.  I shouldn't have to show up 10 minutes early to catch a bus that should be coming by every 20 minutes according to the schedule.  I shouldn't have to stand in the middle of downtown traffic to flag down the 28x Airport Flyer when I'm standing at the stop and have an enormous purple suitcase.  When I'm going to work, I look up when I should be arriving...And then go back 1-2 time blocks to make sure I'm on time since I can't trust the bus.

Bus riders understand not all buses use the exclusive bus lanes, but maybe Port Authority should build the delays that happen every day into the schedule.  For example, there is not a chance that an inbound 71B takes a similar amount of time during the morning rush hour as it does mid-day.  I know this from experience.  Why doesn't the schedule know this?

The buses are so bad that now that I am two miles from work, I walk to and from every day.  In fact, I often BEAT the 71B home.  That means as I stroll two miles down Fifth Avenue, not a single bus passes me.  On the busiest section of the busiest non-highway street in Pittsburgh (data according to me).  How is this possible?

Finally, we live in Pittsburgh.  It's cold or raining or miserable most of the year.  I would gladly take fewer stops in exchange for heated bus shelters.  It would also be nice if these imaginary shelters could have bus arrival information.

From having to be 10 minutes early (I shouldn't have to play it safe!) to being prepared to wait for a couple buses since rush hour means over crowded buses ... PAT is like a powder keg.  You just never know when its going to blow up on your commute.

I do ride the bus daily.  And yes, it would take me the exact amount of time to drive in/out to work.  So honestly ... I treat PAT like I treat Airplane travel.

Pros -
It is rare to find I can't get a bus to a place I want to go. Truth be told I don't leave the city a whole lot, but anytime I want to get somewhere with some leg work I can find a bus to take me where I want.

My morning bus (especially the insanely early 5am 86 from Bloomfield to work and the gym downtown) is almost always on time. 

Cons - 
It's a known fact that the last 54 from the Southside to the East End/Oakland/Etc rarely to never comes and the ""last one"" is NOT late enough to be considered an after the bars options to get home.

It's pretty common for the buses to either be a full 15 min early or 10 min late.

I've seen more than one person pee themselves.

I've had a bus driver just plain ignore my request for a stop and then ignore ME while I'm telling them as much.

PACKED buses and constantly cutting routes and trips.

Dirty buses. I've seen a dirty diaper or two.

But it's expensive, at least compared to the Metro Transit in Minneapolis that I'm used to. On Port Authority, it's $2.25 for a ticket, and an extra $1 for a transfer (which only gets you on one more bus, not all the way to your destination if it requires a bunch of transfers.) Coming from a maximum of $3 for two and a half hours of bus rides (express bus during rush hour), Port Authority is steep. I had to grab cash a couple of different times just to make sure I could keep paying fares throughout the days.

There's no day pass. Boo. If you're traveling a lot throughout the day, it adds up fast without some sort of pass.

Also, the 28X doesn't pick up passengers coming from downtown into Oakland (or drop them off in the reverse direction.) Very frustrating, especially with a Megabus terminal only three blocks away from one of the stops.

Port Authority constantly causes me a great deal of anxiety.  I have been riding the bus for as long as I can remember. We never had a car in my family. Now I am starting to feel like I've taken the bus for granted.

I have a license but I choose not to drive...because I work Downtown and the cost of renting a parking space Downtown is HIGH!!!

4701,9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA,M9-nW-tuuPeEW67vsen9NQ,"As a car-less denizen of PGH, I rely on PAT buses to get from Point A to Point B.  Living in Oakland, PAT offers buses to many places I need to go (downtown, the grocery store, the airport, etc.). As a PITT employee, the price (free) is right.

Having said this, I have several gripes:

1.) Buses almost never run on time, and there's no way to know when the next one is coming other than asking the other people at the bus stop how long they've been waiting. Come on, it's 2014--a GPS-enabled device should be in every bus so you can check to see where it is, or there should be a SMS alert system.  Singapore had this for their buses in 2010!

2.) Some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant. More than once, a bus has passed me when waiting at a stop for no apparent reason, or has failed to hold on for 5-10 s. as I huffed and puffed to catch it. For whatever reason, the outbound 28X seems to be especially problematic.  True story: Last time I rode it, the driver didn't know where she was going, and we ended up crossing the Liberty Bridge, despite pax telling her this wasn't the route. To make matters worse, this was the last 28X of the night, so due to this detour, I didn't get home until after 1am.

3.) Regardless of which route you ride, the clientele can be a bit sketch. Some drivers will also let homeless people ride without paying/a voucher out of pity. On one occasion, a pax regaled the bus with nonsensical poetry (not sure if he was under the influence or just mentally incapacitated...), and the driver did nada about it (though it was amusing).

4.) The system of when to pay is nonsensical.  Despite having a terminal degree and having lived in PGH for 3 years, I still haven't figured it out, and have to rely on cues from the bus driver. While I understand the reason behind it (the free zone downtown), there must be a less confusing solution.  Get on it!

5.) For those who don't have a PITT or CMU pass, fares--including monthly passes--are expensive ($2.50 per trip). Pro Tip: For a round trip, when you pay for the first leg, ask for a transfer and use it on the second leg--this shaves $1.50 off your fare.

6.) Even in Oakland, where route options are better than in most areas of the city, there are no direct buses to some areas I'd like to visit (e.g., the Strip). Also, other than the P1 from downtown, buses serving the East Busway only run during rush hour on weekdays, and even the P1 only runs hourly off rush hour.

I've ridden public transit in other cities, and for its size, PGH should have a better system and lower fares.  For starters, the T (light rail) should be expanded to run east-west along the busways, given that it's currently a line to nowhere.",0,1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA,0,2,2014-07-12,review,1

I was actually incredulous at how big the eponymous Jo Jo Omelet could be, but whoa! First of all, Jo Jo's sort of has this reputation for being a bit dingy, having bad service (as it originated as a diner mostly for truckers), etc. but it was, all-told, pretty fun. We went on a Saturday morning and the wait was about 15 minutes for a table. The place has absolutely no ambiance whatsoever, but it was crowded with couples and families. The servers/waitresses are extremely ornery, but I think it's part of the experience. 

Once we were seated, we looked around at what everyone else was eating. Surprisingly, no one was eating the Jo Jo Omelet, but they do have HUGE pancakes, excellent looking egg dishes, etc., so I can safely say that basically everything here is good. Well, we did come for a reason, so of course we went for the Jo Jo Omelets... The only mistake was ordering one each. We should have really shared one, and even then, it can be shared among three or four easily. So what is a Jo Jo Omelet you ask (aside from the most expensive thing on their menu at $9)? It's basically a HUGE omelet filled with sausage, peppers and onions, wrapped around a ton of home fries (see my photo for an idea!). Not only was everyone gawking at us when the server placed them on our table, but we were sort of in shock at how big the thing actually is. With that, we dug in and I was successfully able to put away about half before my heart began to hurt. My friend was able to eat even less. Sadly, we sent most of ours back (just because we were so full), so word to the wise, SHARE IT.

If you are the opposite of any of these points, this place is probably worth a try for you.

We had a horrendous wait, but I think that was a complete fluke:  we had a huge group and there was an event that weekend...I don't think anyone with less than 3-4 had that long of a wait at all.

But the food?  Oh God.

Pros:  Portions are massive, all the other reviews will tell you that.
            1) Prices are reasonable, cheap even, but I suppose that has something to do with the fact that the first pound or two of your meal is pure potato.  Seriously...I think I had at *least* three idaho russets in chipped form on my plate alone.
            2) ....uhm.  ....  Nothing was dry?

Cons:  There was no color anywhere.  Absolutely everything on every plate I saw in the place was some blend of beige.  Potatoes, egg white, pancake, sausage...after you tilted the whatever-grease-that-was out of your dish, everything was the same color.  
             Half my dish was potato.  
             The egg was not over-medium, it was still-runny, even the whites.  I presume this was because they were slammed, and didn't have time to cook what were almost certainly factory-chicken eggs.
             The sausage was not identifiably sausage.
             I had my entire day's required calories in butter alone on the toast.
             There was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu.  Nothing raw, nothing green, nothing fresh, not even as an ingredient. Even McDonalds has a fruit cup, ffs!  TACO BELL has better quality food!

Annie and I are at Ross Park mall walking around trying to figure out our lunch destination when serendipitously her phone rings and it's her Dad, ""Brother Len"" calling to ask us to lunch at this hidden gem.  Nice!  I prefer not to make decisions on the weekend.  Next we are headed down to the strip on a relatively pleasant saturday afternoon.  The locals are out en masse and parking is at a premium.  In keeping with our serendipitous saturday theme we find prime parking right in front of Kaya (another one of our favs').  We walk towards ""Labad's grocery"".  Now, I've been to this grocery before and have certainly walked by it numerous times and had never known of the little cafe located in the back of the grocery.  Len's been a regular here for years and is friends with the lovely syrian family who own the joint.  We walk into the back room which is exactly what I was hoping for in that it was very small a few tables, middle eastern decorations on the wall and a cozy somewhat seperate room which had for some reason multiple stuffed animals next to the table.  There also was a sheet hanging blocking something from view and if I'm to believe Len it was a camel :-).  Annie and I have a seat with Len who is sitting with the patriarch of this family ""Fayed"" I believe his name is.  Fayed has to leave to tend to the store and multiple operations occurring.  One of the sons is selling ""shish kabob"" on the sidewalk.  This is also a grocery store with sidewalk sales and of course the small cafe in the back.  I love the entrepreneurial spirit of first generation immigrants.  Len orders me up some coffee.  It was a very strong version of coffee served in a tiny mug.  I'm guessing their version of espresso.  Len takes care of ordering, which is good because I can't claim to be a middle eastern food connoiessur and tend to be lost after I exhaust the hummus and gyro options.  He orders us some type of platter, not sure the name of the platter itself but can describe the offerings.  I liked the metal plate that all of this food was served.  It was a large round plate sectioned off for each dip/option.  It was served with warm pita bread.  I like family style dining and this platter certainly encouraged sharing.  Now, the only thing that I was familiar with was the hummus and the black olives.  The hummus was as good as any I've ever had.  It was very authentic mashed chickpeas blended with olive oil, lemon and garlic.  It was really good served with the pita chips.  The olives were really good briny small black olives served with the pit.  The other sides were Baba Ganoug, which is really good eggplant dip with oil, garlic and pepper.  I have tried this in the past and really didn't like it.  I really liked this, so I guess the stuff I had in the past wasn't authentic.  Now, one of the two new things I had and probably my favorite was the shanklish salad, which isn't the type of salad you may be thinking of.  There was no lettuce,  but instead homemade aged cheese that is very good and delicate.  The salad also consisted of onions, tomatoes and oil.  It was great.  The final side of this dish wsa the macdoose, which I had never tried before.  It is eggplant pieces stuffed with walnuts and drowned in olive oil.  This wasn't my favorite, but I found myself however I kept eating it, so I guess I must have thought it was okay.  This would have been a great vegetarian meal (first time I've ever said that sentence) if I stopped there.  But, Len also ordered me a skewer of lamb.  At first it was a bit undercooked, but one of the sons (Lawrence?) grabbed it and grilled it for a few more minutes and then it was more to my liking.  I really like lamb and grilled with middle eastern seasonings is a treat with a little pita and some onions and tomatoes.  Annie had a skewer of grilled chicken, which also was seasoned nicely and cooked well.  Throughout the lunch we were greeted like family from other members of the family including ""Mama"" who you just want to wrap up and take home with you.  The guy on the grill (another son can't recall name) also was very warm and friendly and had this killer ""handlebar"" mustache.  Fayed stopped back after we were done with lunch and spent some time chatting with us.  He is a really interesting guy and a true renaissance man with vocations that have included the military, principal in school, chef amongst other things.  One of the most interesting things I found about this guy is that in spite of being a syrian christian part of his history includes teaching the koran to the bedouin (nomadic desert dwelling arab group). A couple other notes Len who knows this type of food says it's the best authentic middle eastern food in Pittsburgh.  Next time I'm there I will definitely try the kibbee, which is spiced ground beef w/pine nuts and stuffing. It's a favorite and you can get it raw if you order in advance.  That would be adventorous.",1,9D4PMia-8WqCYXnr7TM0Pw,0,4,2009-07-12,review,3

I'm pretty sure every place in the entirety of Allegheny County that serves gyros claims to have ""The best gyros in Pittsburgh,"" but from what I've seen, Labad's gets the title.

But it doesn't just stop at the delicious gyros.  There are few other places to get sheep's milk feta, for instance, and the hummus made there is a great fill-in for when I'm too dang lazy to make my own.  And their bulk falafel mix... I can't say I've had better.  The falafel bucket is empty probably about 60% of the times I go, and there's a reason for that.

The folks who work there are also friendly (seems to be a theme that the places I like have good people in them...) and as I mentioned, one of the most epic mustaches in the world works at Labad's.

The store/restaurant are owned by a family from Syria who have always been friendly when we go in.  I guess my husband has gotten to know them pretty well because they always come out and greet him when we visit and have taken to asking why we haven't been in more recently.  (Invariably the answer is TOO MUCH WORK!)

If you're feeling adventurous, try the Sleek -- it is a dish made with kale, garlic, and bulgar wheat and is ohhhh so yummy (and packed with good nutrition!).  The gyros (hubby prefers traditional, I prefer chicken) are TO DIE FOR and come loaded with meat, veggies, and tahini.  The hummus is also delicious.  And the prices are good, especially when you take into account how much food you get.

Don't have time to sit down at eat?  The food sold in the front of the store is just as tasty.  You can even buy specialties like Sleek to go.

I had arrived to Pittsburgh at 6am via bus from NYC and had several options for renting a car (see photo). Avis turned out to be the best deal on top of being located in an easy-to-find location (in addition to being easy to return the car).

I was aware of a 29-minute grace period before being charged another day (or hour). The clock/timer on the parking garage entrance was 6 minutes fast, and me being me, this mattered. It said I returned at 8:47 even though my cell phone showed 8:41am. I immediately took a photo, intending to use this in case I were to be overcharged, even though the location doesn't open for business until 9am and wouldn't be able to rent the car out to anyone for another ~20 minutes anyway.

I was back in Pittsburgh on October 9th and made it a special point to get back to the place so I could resolve the situation in person. It turned out that it's hard for the particular store location to make adjustments if it's been more than a few days. The guy there, Francis, said it's not a huge deal to make the adjustment but that it's out of his control and that if I call the 800 number, it should be fine.

Pause for ~6 months.

So yeah, today I finally made time to pick up the papers and phone and make a call. They first said I returned the car late and then after I explained the situation and offered to send the photo I took that demonstrates the clock discrepancy, they gave me a 'one-time courtesy' and I'm now ~75 dollars richer.

I ran into an issue which the staff were quick to solve. I have only a debit card, and I had only enough money on it to cover the cost of the rental (since the insurance was prepaid). Avis needed to authorize a $200 deposit in addition to the rental, and while I had that much cash, they don't take cash. My wife had more on her own debit card, but she doesn't drive, so they couldn't rent the car to her. After a few minutes of stress, the staff suggested that we shorten the rental to 1 day, charge that (and the deposit) to my debit card, drive to a branch where I could deposit the cash, and call back to extend the rental to its original length. We did exactly that and it turned out great.

Ladies and Gents, to comprehend what I am about to lay upon you I feel it's only right that I paint a picture of the womb from whence it came.
 
Welcome to Da Burgh, Ahhrn City --An old east coast city in Southwestern Pennsylvania, situated on the hills and valleys carved out by the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela.  It rains a good deal here.  The city was built by many Eastern Europeans, some Italian, and some German immigrants who worked their asses off in the steel mills years ago.  Currently, Pittsburgh is much less blue-collar, but it still maintains much of rough blue-collar charm.  People here are genuine, love their football, beer, cigarettes (Marlboros and Camels not Parliament Lights), and facial hair (usually unkempt ones with neck beardage or the cookie duster mustaches often popular with middle-aged men with last names ending in ""ski"".)

Only out of a city such as Pittsburgh, could the Primanti Bros. Sandwich become a legendary food.

A Primanti Bros. Sandwich starts with thick slice of homemade bread, then the usual suspects of meats, cheeses, french fries are put on top, and then sweet & sour slaw is slung on top of that, and finally a tomato, and another piece of thick homemade bread.  The entire creation is plopped down flimsy piece of cooking parchment and shoved across the counter your way.  It's a huge toppling sloppy mess.  The only way to fit the damn thing in your mug is too smash it down before you bite in.  Whatever your modus operandi for eating a Primanti, there just ain't a way to eat it with dignity and still eat it right.

If you're having trouble visualizing this, check out their website. Besides their city menu has the #2 best seller indicated and yet oddly enough absolutely no mention whatsoever of the #1 or #3? primantibrothers.com

The true yinzer sandwich option that I recommend is the Kolbassi and Cheese.  The Kolbassi is split open and dropped into the fryer.  Yes, a deep fried sausage topped with cheese, fries, and slaw.  The grease just glistening from the singed flesh as it absorbs into the thick white bread (dignity is overrated anyway). Make sure yinz warsh it dahn wit ah cold ahhrn city, en'at.  (translation: Make sure you wash it down with a cold Iron City Beer and that.)

Primanti Bros. is definitely not diet food, but most definitely a 100% genuine Pittsburgh food.  It is disgusting in all the right ways.

Of course I paying attention and taking notes :)  When they mentioned Primanti's and Pittsburgh I was like Yes! I'm there!  I could not wait to get my hands on this giant sammich of all sammiches.  My only regret is that I couldn't get it with a Yeungling :( All the more reason to come back!  Ok, so I went here with my host and we decided to strategize.  I got the capicola ham with provolone and he got the steak and cheese.  We got two sammiches and two cokes for $16, what a deal! We were supposed to share but ended up downing our own sammiches. I forgot to ask if the coleslaw was sweet before I ordered so I was a little worried, not a fan of sweet coleslaw.  Luckily, it was great! 
Here's the nitty gritty.  The sandwich bread is two thick slices of soft, white italian bread.  They put at least half a pound of meat on it, plenty of cheese, tomatoes, and a fresh coleslaw (not the mayonaissey type that I was expecting).  It's more like a marinated shredded cabbage, the marinade is tangy and vinegary.  The piece de resistance is that the sandwich also contains a huge mound of fries right in the middle.  The fries taste fresh, reminiscent of boardwalk fries back in the day, only better.  At the table they had ketchup, mustard and apple cider vinegar!  Any one from MD would appreciate that ;-)  All I needed was Old Bay seasoning and it woulda been heaven.  Maybe next time I'll take that in my purse...ssshh! Needless to say I devoured this bad boy and desperately needed a nap afterwards.    I came. I saw. I ate.

Which was $2.95 by the way.  God bless the Burgh.  

So the sandwich is as I remember.  Huge, but if you squeeze you can get your mouth around it.  I realized my second time around that there's a reason they can keep prices low.  There's not a whole lot of meat in the sandwich.  It's dwarfed by the coleslaw and the fries.  I'd also pass on the cheesesteak next time.  It was a square beef patty which didn't seem right and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  Would get pastrami next time for sure.

Food: Well, it's been explained enough here already but: it's a sandwich ... with fries and coleslaw on top!! Never seen anything like this before.

Primanti Brothers came up at the top of the list.  I walked over to the shop and took a seat at the bar.

I ordered, and the gentleman next to me said the sandwich was good, he was from Illinois and said that he had seen the place on Diners Drive Ins and Dives.  That amped up my expectations a bit.  

The waitress who was friendly mentioned that the sandwich was a mess, but that was a good thing.  But speaking of messes, the grill and fryers were filthy, but then again what else should I expect.

My sandwich arrived and it was an impressive quantity of food and utterly unique meal between bread.  There is a rectangular patty, provelone cheese, fries topped by slaw between two slices of italian bread.  The bread was great, but the rest of the sandwich was short on flavor.  The patty was just kinda a brown mass, and the fries and slaw topping the patty were just kinda there.  I found myself adding malt vinnegar to the slaw and eventually dipping in ketchup to add  some flavor.

When I arrived into the city, I parked my car and made my way to Market Square location, where I was told that it was also where a few scenes of She's Out of My League was filmed, (which by the way, I enjoyed that movie since it so closely hit home to a dork like me), but upon arrival, I was mortified to see nothing but construction equipment and chain link fences.

But anyway, I go into Primanti's, and I'm bombarded by Pittsburgh sports - this does not bother me, but the sheer magnitude was a bit unexpected.  The wall of Clemente, Steel Curtain photos, and my personal favorite, the shoe-string tackle of Nick Harper, which I find amusing to be considered one of the greatest plays in Pittsburgh sports apparently.  The rest of the establishment is clean and well-traveled appearing, and lots of high-def televisions satiates the sports-lover's attention whilst waiting on food.

So being the tourist that I am, I don't really know what to get, so I ask the waitress of ""what is THE food for a tourist like me?""  With a confident smirk, she simply says ""pastrami,"" and I thank her for the suggestion, and I realize that it wasn't so much ""a suggestion"" as it was ""the order,"" and five minutes later, this monstrosity on a baking sheet is presented to me.  Thin-sliced pastrami, cole slaw, tomato, and I think there was some cheese in there, but a fistful of fries as well - you guys know the drill.

So in conclusion, great success.  I thought the pastrami sandwich was the stuff of legend, and just thinking about it has me kind of craving one again, even after lunch.

When people say to split a sandwich here they aren't joking. I split a roast beef and provolone with the cole slaw and fries (on the sandwich of course). The roast beef is thin cut and served hot almost like cheese steak meat with the provolone melted on top. They also add lettuce, tomato, vinegar based cole slaw (I hate mayo and liked this cole slaw since no mayo), and of course a ton on fries to the sandwich. The fries are actually pretty good on the sandwich but combine that with an Iron City beer (great beer) and their chili cheese fries (chili was good but they use ""fake cheese"" sauce which hardens in your stomach like a brick) and you'll have a great Pittsburgh meal that you won't even be able to finish before you get full.

What a rip off.  2nd experience, today, equally as awful.  But as i said... waitstaff was great.  I ordered a ""Pitts-burger"" with coleslaw and fries on the side.  Seriously, the quality of the burger I was served made 7-11 mini mart burgers seem gourmet.

Sorry 3 way.

I love this sandwich. You will too. You will also be full. Oh so very full. You will have coleslaw coming off your chin and french fries overflowing your basket after you're done. And if you do not finish, you will take it home, or to your hotel, or to the spirit shop down the street and munch on the leftover french fries while the cashiers aren't looking because you're not supposed to be eating in there.

Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. 

Think a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.

First, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. 

My dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The ""bacon"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)

Like Deep Dish pizza in Chicago or bagels in New York. You just gotta, ok? Locals seem to be split on whether its worth it...so, saddle on up to give it a shot yourself. 

Sitting outside on Market Square in the sunshine (and with Batman filming in the near distance!), we embarked on my first Primanti experience. Bros is right...these are definitely NOT dainty sandwiches, by any means! DO not come here on a first date, there is literally no way to eat this beast politely. 

My turkey and cheese was a ""lighter"" option, if that exists...but I will still full for the requisite 29 hours or so. Did it blow my mind? No. Did I find it fun and interesting and did it taste good? YES! Wash it down with a Diet Coke and we were set to jet to take Pittsburgh by storm the rest of the day.

Maybe not the best sandwich I've ever had in my life, but if it was any random sandwich shop I'd happened to stumble into, it would definitely be five stars without a second thought.

The chili cheese fries were among the best I've ever had. I don't know what they do to them - it's not the chili that's particularly great, it's not the cheese that's particularly great, and it's not the fries that are particularly great. But somehow, putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable awesome.

The sandwich itself (I got the corned beef) was very good despite the fact that I hate coleslaw. But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add.

Every sandwich here is huge, not really due to the protein, but due to the handful(s) of fried and slaw and the thick bread each one is built with. I opted for the Colossal fish and cheese sandwich (6.99).  The fish had a nice crisp batter, the fires were a bit soggy , the bread was nice and soft and the slaw was decent.  Alone I loved the fish, All together the starch of the bread and fried over power the fish. There was hot sauce at the table to help add flavor (frank's red hot style).

The pastrami had a nice taste but could have tasted more ""homemade"". The Italian bread was a nice touch, but eat quickly or the bread will dissolve into the meat/slaw. 

Two complaints. The sandwiches are not as big as you would think. They are bigger than most deli-style sandwiches but not quite as colossal as I thought it would be.

Yes, the place is small, it is in Market Square, and will remain there, wouldn't you be disappointed if one day you wanted Primanti's and no more Market Square location?  I know I would.  If I were in the downtown region and had that craving I wouldn't want to have to work my way up to the Strip just for a bite of that Pittsburgh goodness.  

The 'it's a Pittsburgh' thing comments baffle me.  If you have food shows featuring the sandwich, magazines writing about it, and it's considered the 'Manliest Restaurant in America,'  I think that means it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.  Why else would Primanti's be featured on such media?  Why else would these people centered around shows and magazines venture to a Primanti's?  I mean that has to show you it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.

And 'it's so greasy?'  Did you not watch them makes your sandwich, which you picked from their extensive menu, on the griddle in front of you?  Expect it to be greasy, they are frying it for you and melting that cheese on it.  Maybe don't even pay attention to the greasy factor, especially with that crunchy coleslaw and heap of fries placed between those two thick slices of Italian bread.

I am not a big fry fan in the first place.  I would like to see some other options for bread like a wheat or whole grain option.

If you've never sat by the grill, you should, just to see them in action.  On a busy lunch day, it's not uncommon for them to have 15 things going at once, and they keep track of what's what via...broken french fries.  I've never seen or heard them get anything wrong, either!  While I wouldn't call them chefs, as the menu at the end of the day is simple, they definitely have a solid skill set at the griddle.

If you've never been to Primaniti's, here are a few tips from a seasoned veteran.  
Tip 1:  Always get fried egg.  Always.  On everything.  
Tip 2:  Pick up a bottle of hot sauce and sploosh it on the fries...those of you complaining about bland fries definitely need to try the hot sauce technique, as it makes a definite difference.  
Tip 3: The ""cheesesteak"" sucks and is a travesty that people are encouraged to order this abomination, as compared to many other items of deliciousness on the menu. 
Tip 4: I'm a  big fan of capicola (with egg) and the colossal fish.  The fish is huge, and you will feel like a fat kid if you finish it.  
Tip 5: A 23oz  ""Iron"" is only like $4.  Get one and talk like a Yinzer for a complete experience.

Now you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a restaurant that is piling anything on top of a sandwich to try to stand out.

Primanti's, however, isn't some new fad. They have been putting fries and cole slaw on their sandwiches for roughly 745 years (Note: that may be slightly innacurate, but the point is, they've been around a while). This started as a way for the blue collar workers of Pittsburgh to be able to carry their whole lunch in one hand, to eat on th go... and a great idea was born. Adding a fried egg to any sandwich is an option, and it is also almost always a good idea - and should be mandatory if you order the cappicola and cheese. 

Primanti's has a lot of locations now, pretty much all around the Pittsburgh area, but unlike most chains, they seem to have suffered no growing pains from expansion, and every restaurant seems to be top notch and consistent in food quality. The regular sandwiches are big, but if you want to grow your waistline a couple inches in one sandwich, get the colossal fish. It is ridiculously large, and the fish is great. If you're feeling a little adventurous and have never had a real sardine before, try the sardine sandwich. These aren't those slimy little jarred bait fish you get in grocery stores. They are nice sized real sardines - a little oily, just enough briny sea flavor, and being Primanti's, you get plenty of them.

To start we tried the chili since it was posted on the wall as great chili.  A few friends told me ""don't get the chili, you're there for a sandwich.""  They were right.  The chili wasn't good.  We don't put beans in chili here, and it should be thick, meaty, and able to eat through a spoon.  This stuff was weak, watery and full of beans and maybe some other vegetables.  Our chili would make people in Pittsburgh fall over dead.

The real novelty at Primanti Brothers is that all of there sandwiches include french fries and cole slaw inside that sandwich. And to that I say... ""who cares"".  I personally didn't care for the fries and slaw inside my sandwich, but I am also not a huge french fry or cole slaw fan. (I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. 

The ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients.

To be fair, let me just say that my apple allergy prohibited me from partaking in their coleslaw and this could lead to my impression that they aren't all that special.  If you don't already know, Primanti Bros is known for serving up HUMONGOUS sandwiches piled high with meat, French fries and coleslaw.  

I ordered their fish filet sandwich and it was just bad.  The fried fish filet was incredibly dry, the French fries were soggy and had been sitting out for a while and the vast amounts of tartar sauce I tried to dump on each bite did not do anything to help the taste.  

One thing you should DEF order if you come to the Primanti Bros shop is their chili cheese fries.  They are SO incredibly good.  The cheese is thick and they are very generous with the portions and chili - cheese - fries ratio.  This helped me to enjoy my meal more.

Primanti Bros - though famous - is not the type of place you would say ... take a date.  They're not fancy and this is the type of place where you are always welcome to dress down and you cannot be scared to use your hands and just dig into a sandwich.

I don't give low ratings easily or often, so believe me: this place pushed all of my buttons to earn this awful review. In fact, the single star was only earned because the place is cleaner and more comfy than some of the other Primanti places I've been too. It kind of has an old diner feeling to it and I liked that. 

Alas, that's all I liked.

So, why such a low score? Well:

The service was terrible. After spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming to refill my water or ask for my actual order - note, the place was almost completely empty - I went to the register to ask for something to eat, which I'd started to think I had to do after watching a couple people do the same (in hindsight, I probably misinterpreted their actions, but my mistake does not excuse what happened next). My waiter looked at me and went, ""Don't you get the concept of a restaurant? Haven't you been to any restaurants, like, ever? Sit back down and I'll take your order."" 

And not even in a joking manner that made me feel like I could smile about my mistake - this guy was being a condescending, rude, arrogant person. It was unbelievable. Utterly, totally unbelievable. If I hadn't met company there that night, I would have walked out right then.

To make matters worse, this was not a good night to order anything at Primanti's. The coleslaw was way too sweet and there was far too much of it, the fries were bland and had no texture at all, and there was barely any meat on my sandwich at all. The result? A big pile of carbs that really didn't taste great after the first few bites, rather than a delicious sandwich.

Before you all kill me, please note: I LIKED my meal at Mt. Lebanon's Primanti location. They also have a more diverse menu, which is always a bonus for me - I like having more options. I think in the future, I will stick to that location in this local chain, where even on a busy night I managed to get food in a decent amount of time.

Food:  The portions are huge, not very greasy, served nice and hot but over all very bland.  I got the Colossal Fish and Cheese sandwich.  The beer batter fish was a very large piece and by itself was not bad tasting at all (just a little under seasoned.)  The fries were limp and had no seasoning what so ever. The fries were the worse part of the sandwich.  The coleslaw was  very mild, sweet and vinegar base, and by itself it was ok, but put everything together between two slices of white bread and it made for a bland pile of flavorless starch.  The bread was also too soft and did not hold up well at all, and the cheese was nonexistent.  I ended up having to add a ton of salt, pepper and malt vinegar to my sandwich, picked it apart and ate the pieces with my fingers.

Price:  For the size of the portions you get, the price is great!  I got two sandwiches and a soda for about $16.  Their sandwiches range from around $6 - $8 each, and are a good value since you will definitely leave full (I took home left overs.)

Atmosphere:  After reading a few reviews about the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place was not packed with tourist.  For being such a small dinner, the place was fairly empty so I was able to sit anywhere I liked (being a solo traveler, restaurants often try to stick me at the bar but I prefer to sit at a table.)  The tables were clean and organized well, and each table had a stack of paper menus to look at.  It felt like a comfy, good ol' local dinner where you can casually relax and eat.

Staff:  During my visit, the staff was great!  There was only one waitress and one cook, but both were pleasant and greeted me as soon as I walked in.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  The cook also thanked me for patronizing there while I was leaving.

Over all, I basically came here just to say that I visited a famous Pittsburgh restaurant, but I most likely will not go there again.  If I was with friends or family who wanted to go to Primanti's I would go along, but I wouldn't go solo.  The blandness of the food is what kills it for me.

If you have to put all that hot sauce on the sandwich to make it palatable, why bother?  (The server, as he walked away, told me it's really good with hot sauce, which was just Tabasco, which I don't like, any way!)

They left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich!

I don't think the ""meat"" you order makes a difference in the bland taste, as it's overpowered by the slaw and fries. The bread was dry on the crust and yet soggy from the slaw/oil from fries. The wait staff wasn't friendly either. They seemed to have the ""I don't need try to so hard because we're busy no matter what"" attitude. We had to go up to the bar to get refills on our drinks after waiting over 10 min. for the waitress to notice we were out.

If we were bad people we could have stolen the check from the last table as they had paid with cash. Once we got a servers attention and got the table cleared and our drinks and food ordered the server forgot our drinks and when we where finally able to flag her down our food came out not even 5 minutes later. In total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food. Don't even think about getting a refill I had to walk in and ask the bartender for refills for me and my family after being ignored several times. When we were done we wanted to leave but couldn't till we paid the bill and because we paid with credit card we had to wait for the server to return with our card.

Their sandwiches were always tasty, worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc. So, when my parents came to visit, and we made a trip out that-a-way, I knew that would be a lunch stop. We ended up coming into Pittsburgh on Sunday around 1pm. I knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait. We got a table after 15 to 20 minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants, which was ok. 

We ordered our beers and were told that she'd come back and take our order. She came back 20 minutes later, with the beers and took our order. After that, we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for 35 minutes. When we did finally get our food, it was ice cold. The fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold, and the meat was barely warm. Our table ran out of napkins, and we asked for some, but they never came, finally, the table next to ours handed us a few. Maybe it was because it was cold, but the sandwiches weren't that great. I had very little meat in mine, and more coleslaw that anything else. Also, the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since I last ate here because about 60% of my sandwich was bread. We were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing, but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress. 

Then, my dad went to the bar to pay. He stood there for 10 minutes, behind another customer. The server came up to them and said 'what the hell are you doing up here?', in those words!! My dad was so stunned be just stood there, the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill, so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else, when my dad said 'excuse me, i need to pay too', she replied to him ' Jeez, you guys are so demanding! Why the hell are you in such a hurry"". That is when their tip went straight out the door with us. 

We were ok waiting for a table, we were even ok waiting for our food; it took them one hour from the time we sat down, to the time we got our food, and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner.

The sandwich comes out and its a monster.  I love the italian bread, the beef patty and cheese, the slaw was good (shredded cabbage, not like southern cole slaw).  Everything was fresh but, again, the fries were the worst part.  Underdone, underseasoned.  Definitely my least favorite part.

Nonetheless, I would definitely return because I want to try some of the other menu items.  I've heard double-meat is the way to go.  I'm intrigued.",0,NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ,0,3,2014-01-21,review,0

Most times, when out of towners ask for a local spot to eat, I'm one of the few that actually pushes them AWAY from this defacto Burgh tradition.  Don't get me wrong, Primanti's isn't bad, but it isn't exactly great either.  Typically I end up smothering mine in hot sauce and salt/pepper to get some flavor onto otherwise bland sandwiches.

With that said, every once in awhile, I get this odd, insatiable craving for a cap and egg sandwich (w/ onion)... and when I do cave to that temptation, it's oddly satisfying.

On the experience front, Primanti's is definitely one of a kind.  I don't know of anywhere else you can get burly bartenders to slam down a mess of a sandwich in wax paper on your table (something the suburban restaurants fail to provide).  If you're going to go, I highly suggest going either to the original in the Strip, or, if you don't feel like waiting in line during the busy times, the Market Square location.",0,NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ,0,3,2014-02-01,review,1
4996,UEmQ9VRVdk67gNBWCK9MTw,ri4UDju9ruTEuoFbYDrIhg,Worst service ever.  The waitress and I use that term loosely rolled her eyes at any question when ordering and yelled at someone at the table for asking for coleslaw on the side.  Then she had to come back and re ask the orders again and got mad when we repeated about the coleslaw since she didn't repeat it back.  When she brought out the food she just slammed the food down and just shouted out the name of one of the sandwiches um are you asking who had which sandwich which is your job to remember anyways.  I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh to have to worry about avoiding this place.,0,NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ,1,1,2014-02-15,review,0

Tried the pittsburgher cheesesteak, I was expecting a regular burger patty or sliced steak, ended up being a weird patty almost like a meatloaf (not a burger). Not sure I'd order that again. Pastrami and cheese was still good. Wish the egg came a little runny.",0,NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ,0,4,2014-02-16,review,0

I don't like fries and I don't eat cheese, but I still loved my sandwich! I ordered the chicken sans cheese and fries, of course. The cole slaw was very good; I loved that it didn't have mayo in it and the flavor was great. Our waitress recommended that we try their hot sauce on the sandwiches and so glad we did because it really spiced it up and made the sandwich even better. My partner ordered the real deal and said it was delicious as well! We also ordered a ""small"" beer, which is a full 12 oz glass, pretty sweet deal. 

Highly recommend this place",0,NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ,0,4,2014-02-23,review,2

The waitresses all rolled their eyes and glared at me for not wanting my fries on top of my sandwich. (Not to mention the waitress was in the skimpiest tank top with her bra hanging out while waiting on us and grilling food. Gross.) I get that your famous for having fries on the sandwich but regardless, a customer should be able to get what they want. This place was trashy, dirty and probably not even up to code.",0,NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ,1,1,2014-03-28,review,1
